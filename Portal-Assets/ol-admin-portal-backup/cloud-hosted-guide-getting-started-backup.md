<p>Open Liberty is an application server designed for the cloud. It&rsquo;s small, lightweight, and designed with modern cloud-native application development in mind. It supports the full MicroProfile and Java EE APIs and is composable, meaning that you can use only the features that you need.</p>

<p>Within this guide you will learn how to run and update a simple REST microservice on an Open Liberty server. Maven will be used&nbsp;throughout the guide to build and deploy the microservice as well as to interact with the running server instance.</p>
