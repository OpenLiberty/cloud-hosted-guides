# OpenLiberty edX Theme

# edX Theme directory

In the `edX Theme` directory you can find a folder containing the `lms` file. That folder is the edX theme and it's used to build the portal.

## Making changes to the portal

 - To make changes to the theme clone the lms folder.
 - Do the required to the code
 - Zip the folder (Make sure it is names `lms.zip`)
 - Go to the openliberty portal admin page [here](https://openliberty.skillsnetwork.site/admin/learning_paths) -> In the left hand menu -> Settings -> Advances -> Under Open Edx Theme -> Press Choose file -> Select the `lms.zip`
 - Also from within the LMS file you can make changes to the JS and CSS used by the page. These can be found within `static/custom`
