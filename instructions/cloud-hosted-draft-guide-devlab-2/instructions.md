::page{title="Welcome to the Deploying a microservice to Kubernetes by using Open Liberty Operator guide!"}

Explore how to deploy a microservice to Kubernetes by using Open Liberty Operator.

In this guide, you will use a pre-configured environment that runs in containers on the cloud and includes everything that you need to complete the guide.

This panel contains the step-by-step guide instructions. You can customize these instructions by using the toolbar at the top of this panel. Move between steps by using either the arrows or the buttons at the bottom of this panel.

The other panel displays the IDE that you will use to create files, edit the code, and run commands. This IDE is based on Visual Studio Code. It includes pre-installed tools and a built-in terminal.




::page{title="What you'll learn"}

You will learn how to deploy a cloud-native application with a microservice to Kubernetes by using the Open Liberty Operator. 

[Kubernetes](https://www.kubernetes.io/) is a container orchestration system. It streamlines the DevOps process by providing an intuitive development pipeline. It also provides integration with multiple tools to make the deployment and management of cloud applications easier. You can learn more about Kubernetes by checking out the [Deploying microservices to Kubernetes](https://openliberty.io/guides/kubernetes-intro.html) guide.

[Kubernetes operators](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/#operators-in-kubernetes) provide an easy way to automate the management and updating of applications by abstracting away some of the details of cloud application management. To learn more about operators, check out this [Operators tech topic article](https://www.openshift.com/learn/topics/operators). 

The application in this guide consists of one microservice, ***system***. The system microservice returns the JVM system properties of its host.

You will deploy the ***system*** microservice by using the Open Liberty Operator. The [Open Liberty Operator](https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty-operator) packages, deploys, and manages Open Liberty applications on Kubernetes-based clusters. The Open Liberty Operator watches Open Liberty resources and creates various Kubernetes resources, including ***Deployments***, ***Services***, and ***Routes***, depending on the configurations. The Operator then continuously compares the current state of the resources, the desired state of application deployment, and reconciles them when necessary.



::page{title="Getting started"}

To open a new command-line session,
select **Terminal** > **New Terminal** from the menu of the IDE.

Run the following command to navigate to the **/home/project** directory:

```bash
cd /home/project
```

The fastest way to work through this guide is to clone the [Git repository](https://github.com/openliberty/guide-openliberty-operator-intro.git) and use the projects that are provided inside:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/openliberty/guide-openliberty-operator-intro.git
cd guide-openliberty-operator-intro
```


The ***start*** directory contains the starting project that you will build upon.

The ***finish*** directory contains the finished project that you will build.



::page{title="Installing the Operator"}


In this Skills Network environment, the Open Liberty Operator is already installed by the administrator. If you like to learn how to install the Open Liberty Operator, you can learn from the [Deploying microservices to OpenShift by using Kubernetes Operators](https://openliberty.io/guides/cloud-openshift-operator.html#installing-the-operators) guide or the Open Liberty Operator [document](https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty-operator/tree/main/deploy/releases/0.8.0#readme).

To check that the Open Liberty Operator has been installed successfully, run the following command to view all the supported API resources that are available through the Open Liberty Operator:
```bash
kubectl api-resources --api-group=apps.openliberty.io
```

Look for the following output, which shows the [custom resource definitions](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/) (CRDs) that can be used by the Open Liberty Operator:

```
NAME                      SHORTNAMES         APIGROUP              NAMESPACED   KIND
openlibertyapplications   olapp,olapps       apps.openliberty.io   true         OpenLibertyApplication
openlibertydumps          oldump,oldumps     apps.openliberty.io   true         OpenLibertyDump
openlibertytraces         oltrace,oltraces   apps.openliberty.io   true         OpenLibertyTrace
```

Each CRD defines a kind of object that can be used, which is specified in the previous example by the ***KIND*** value. The ***SHORTNAME*** value specifies alternative names that you can substitute in the configuration to refer to an object kind. For example, you can refer to the ***OpenLibertyApplication*** object kind by one of its specified shortnames, such as ***olapps***. 

The ***openlibertyapplications*** CRD defines a set of configurations for deploying an Open Liberty-based application, including the application image, number of instances, and storage settings. The Open Liberty Operator watches for changes to instances of the ***OpenLibertyApplication*** object kind and creates Kubernetes resources that are based on the configuration that is defined in the CRD.

::page{title="Deploying the system microservice to Kubernetes"}

To deploy the ***system*** microservice, you must first package the microservice, then create and build a runnable container image of the packaged microservice.

### Packaging the microservice

Ensure that you are in the ***start*** directory and run the following command to package the ***system*** microservice:


```bash
cd /home/project/guide-openliberty-operator-intro/start
mvn clean package
```

### Building the image

Run the following command to download or update to the latest Open Liberty Docker image:

```bash
docker pull icr.io/appcafe/open-liberty:full-java11-openj9-ubi
```

Next, run the ***docker build*** command to build the container image for your application:
```bash
docker build -t system:1.0-SNAPSHOT system/.
```

The ***-t*** flag in the ***docker build*** command allows the Docker image to be labeled (tagged) in the ***name[:tag]*** format. The tag for an image describes the specific image version. If the optional ***[:tag]*** tag is not specified, the ***latest*** tag is created by default.

Next, push your images to the container registry on IBM Cloud with the following commands:

```bash
docker tag system:1.0-SNAPSHOT us.icr.io/$SN_ICR_NAMESPACE/system:1.0-SNAPSHOT
docker push us.icr.io/$SN_ICR_NAMESPACE/system:1.0-SNAPSHOT
```

Run the following command to check the docker images:
```bash
docker images
```

The output is similar to the following example:
```
REPOSITORY                          TAG                      IMAGE ID       CREATED         SIZE
us.icr.io/sn-labs-yourname/system   1.0-SNAPSHOT             5c5890296d6e   2 minutes ago   1.23GB
system                              1.0-SNAPSHOT             5c5890296d6e   2 minutes ago   1.23GB
icr.io/appcafe/open-liberty         full-java11-openj9-ubi   e959985784c2   2 days ago      1.2GB
```

Now you're ready to deploy the image.

### Deploying the image

You can configure the specifics of the Open Liberty Operator-controlled deployment with a YAML configuration file.

Create the ***deploy.yaml*** configuration file in the ***start*** directory.

> Run the following touch command in your terminal
```bash
touch /home/project/guide-openliberty-operator-intro/start/deploy.yaml
```


> Then, to open the deploy.yaml file in your IDE, select
> **File** > **Open** > guide-openliberty-operator-intro/start/deploy.yaml, or click the following button

::openFile{path="/home/project/guide-openliberty-operator-intro/start/deploy.yaml"}



```yaml
apiVersion: apps.openliberty.io/v1beta2
kind: OpenLibertyApplication
metadata:
  name: system
  labels:
    name: system
spec:
  applicationImage: system:1.0-SNAPSHOT
  service:
    port: 9080
  expose: true
  route:
    pathType: ImplementationSpecific
  env:
    - name: WLP_LOGGING_MESSAGE_FORMAT
      value: "json"
    - name: WLP_LOGGING_MESSAGE_SOURCE
      value: "message,trace,accessLog,ffdc,audit"
```


Click the :fa-copy: **copy** button to copy the code and press `Ctrl+V` or `Command+V` in the IDE to add the code to the file.


The ***deploy.yaml*** file is configured to deploy one ***OpenLibertyApplication*** resource, ***system***, which is controlled by the Open Liberty Operator.

The ***applicationImage*** parameter defines what container image is deployed as part of the ***OpenLibertyApplication*** CRD. This parameter follows the ***\\<image-name\\>[:tag]*** format. The parameter can also point to an image hosted on an external registry, such as Docker Hub. The ***system*** microservice is configured to use the ***image*** created from the earlier build. 

The ***env*** parameter is used to specify environment variables that are passed to the container at runtime.

Additionally, the microservice includes the ***service*** and ***expose*** parameters. The ***service.port*** parameter specifies which port is exposed by the container, allowing the microservice to be accessed from outside the container. To access the microservice from outside of the cluster, it must be exposed by setting the ***expose*** parameter to ***true***. After you expose the microservice, the Operator automatically creates and configures routes for external access to your microservice.


Run the following commands to update the **applicationImage** with the **pullSecret** and deploy the **system** microservice with the previously explained configuration:
```bash
sed -i 's=system:1.0-SNAPSHOT=us.icr.io/'"$SN_ICR_NAMESPACE"'/system:1.0-SNAPSHOT\n  pullPolicy: Always\n  pullSecret: icr=g' deploy.yaml
kubectl apply -f deploy.yaml
```

Next, run the following command to view your newly created ***OpenLibertyApplications*** resources:

```bash
kubectl get OpenLibertyApplications
```

You can also replace ***OpenLibertyApplications*** with the shortname ***olapps***.

Look for output that is similar to the following example:

```
NAME      IMAGE                  EXPOSED   RECONCILED   AGE
system    system:1.0-SNAPSHOT    true      True         10s
```

A ***RECONCILED*** state value of ***True*** indicates that the operator was able to successfully process the ***OpenLibertyApplications*** instances. Run the following command to view details of your microservice:

```bash
kubectl describe olapps/system
```

This example shows part of the ***olapps/system*** output:

```
Name:         system
Namespace:    default
Labels:       app.kubernetes.io/part-of=system
              name=system
Annotations:  <none>
API Version:  apps.openliberty.io/v1beta2
Kind:         OpenLibertyApplication

...
```

::page{title="Accessing the microservice"}

To access the exposed ***system*** microservice, the service must be port-forwarded. Run the following command to set up port forwarding to access the ***system*** service:

```bash
kubectl port-forward svc/system 9080
```


Open another command-line session by selecting **Terminal** > **New Terminal** from the menu of the IDE. Access the microservice by running the following command:
```bash
curl -s http://localhost:9080/system/properties | jq
```

When you're done trying out the microservice, press **CTRL+C** in the command line session where you ran the ***kubectl port-forward*** command to stop the port forwarding.

Run the following command to remove the deployed ***system*** microservice:
```bash
kubectl delete -f deploy.yaml
```

::page{title="Specifying optional parameters"}

You can also use the Open Liberty Operator to implement optional parameters in your application deployment by specifying the associated CRDs in your ***deploy.yaml*** file. For example, you can configure the [Kubernetes liveness, readiness and startup probes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-startup-probes/). Visit the [Open Liberty Operator user guide](https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty-operator/blob/main/doc/user-guide-v1beta2.adoc#configuration) to find all of the supported optional CRDs.

To configure the Kubernetes liveness, readiness and startup probes by using the Open Liberty Operator, specify the ***probes*** in your ***deploy.yaml*** file. The ***startup*** probe verifies whether deployed application is fully initialized before the liveness probe takes over. Then, the ***liveness*** probe determines whether the application is running and the ***readiness*** probe determines whether the application is ready to process requests. For more information about application health checks, see the [Checking the health of microservices on Kubernetes](https://openliberty.io/guides/kubernetes-microprofile-health.html) guide.

Replace the ***deploy.yaml*** configuration file.

```



The health check endpoints ***/health/started***, ***/health/live*** and ***/health/ready*** are already created for you. 


Run the following commands to update the **applicationImage** with the **pullSecret** and redeploy the **system** microservice with the new configuration:
```bash
sed -i 's=system:1.0-SNAPSHOT=us.icr.io/'"$SN_ICR_NAMESPACE"'/system:1.0-SNAPSHOT\n  pullPolicy: Always\n  pullSecret: icr=g' deploy.yaml
kubectl apply -f deploy.yaml
```

Run the following command to set up port forwarding to access the ***system*** service:

```bash
kubectl port-forward svc/system 9080
```


Access the microservice by running the following command:
```bash
curl -s http://localhost:9080/system/properties | jq
```

When you're done trying out the microservice, press **CTRL+C** in the command line session where you ran the ***kubectl port-forward*** command to stop the port forwarding.

::page{title="Tearing down the environment"}


When you no longer need your deployed microservice, you can delete all resources by running the following command:

```bash
kubectl delete -f deploy.yaml
```
