::page{title="Welcome to the Deploying a microservice to OpenShift 4 by using Open Liberty Operator guide!"}

Explore how to deploy a microservice to Red Hat OpenShift 4 by using Open Liberty Operator.

In this guide, you will use a pre-configured environment that runs in containers on the cloud and includes everything that you need to complete the guide.

This panel contains the step-by-step guide instructions. You can customize these instructions by using the toolbar at the top of this panel. Move between steps by using either the arrows or the buttons at the bottom of this panel.

The other panel displays the IDE that you will use to create files, edit the code, and run commands. This IDE is based on Visual Studio Code. It includes pre-installed tools and a built-in terminal.



::page{title="What you'll learn"}

You will learn how to deploy a cloud-native application with a microservice to Red Hat OpenShift 4 by using the Open Liberty Operator. 

[OpenShift](https://www.openshift.com/) is a Kubernetes-based platform with added functions. It streamlines the DevOps process by providing an intuitive development pipeline. It also provides integration with multiple tools to make the deployment and management of cloud applications easier. You can learn more about Kubernetes by checking out the [Deploying microservices to Kubernetes](https://openliberty.io/guides/kubernetes-intro.html) guide.

[Kubernetes operators](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/#operators-in-kubernetes) provide an easy way to automate the management and updating of applications by abstracting away some of the details of cloud application management. To learn more about operators, check out this [Operators tech topic article](https://www.openshift.com/learn/topics/operators). 

The application in this guide consists of one microservice, ***system***. The system microservice returns the JVM system properties of its host.

You will deploy the ***system*** microservice by using the Open Liberty Operator. The [Open Liberty Operator](https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty-operator) provides a method of packaging, deploying, and managing Open Liberty applications on Kubernetes-based clusters. The Open Liberty Operator watches Open Liberty resources and creates various Kubernetes resources, including ***Deployments***, ***Services***, and ***Routes***, depending on the configurations. The Operator then continuously compares the current state of the resources with the desired state of application deployment and reconciles them when necessary.



::page{title="Getting started"}

To open a new command-line session,
select **Terminal** > **New Terminal** from the menu of the IDE.

Run the following command to navigate to the **/home/project** directory:

```bash
cd /home/project
```

The fastest way to work through this guide is to clone the [Git repository](https://github.com/openliberty/guide-openliberty-operator-openshift.git) and use the projects that are provided inside:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/openliberty/guide-openliberty-operator-openshift.git
cd guide-openliberty-operator-openshift
```


The ***start*** directory contains the starting project that you will build upon.

The ***finish*** directory contains the finished project that you will build.


::page{title="Installing the Operator"}


A project is created for you to use in this exercise. Run the following command to see your project name:

```bash
oc projects
```

In this Skill Network enviornment, the Open Liberty Operator is already installed by the administrator. If you like to learn how to install the Open Liberty Operator, you can learn from the [Deploying microservices to OpenShift by using Kubernetes Operators](https://openliberty.io/guides/cloud-openshift-operator.html#installing-the-operators) guide or the Open Liberty Operator [document](https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty-operator/blob/master/deploy/releases/0.7.1/readme.adoc).

Run the following command to view all the supported API resources that are available through the Open Liberty Operator:

```bash
oc api-resources --api-group=apps.openliberty.io
```

Look for the following output, which shows the [custom resource definitions](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/) (CRDs) that can be used by the Open Liberty Operator:

```
NAME                     SHORTNAMES        APIGROUP                     NAMESPACED  KIND
openlibertyapplications  olapp,olapps      apps.openliberty.io/v1beta2  true        OpenLibertyApplication
openlibertydumps         oldump,oldumps    apps.openliberty.io/v1beta2  true        OpenLibertyDump
openlibertytraces        oltrace,oltraces  apps.openliberty.io/v1beta2  true        OpenLibertyTrace
```

Each CRD defines a kind of object that can be used, which is specified in the previous example by the ***KIND*** value. The ***SHORTNAME*** value specifies alternative names that you can substitute in the configuration to refer to an object kind. For example, you can refer to the ***OpenLibertyApplication*** object kind by one of its specified shortnames, such as ***olapps***. 

The ***openlibertyapplications*** CRD defines a set of configurations for deploying an Open Liberty-based application, including the application image, number of instances, and storage settings. The Open Liberty Operator watches for changes to instances of the ***OpenLibertyApplication*** object kind and creates Kubernetes resources that are based on the configuration that is defined in the CRD.


::page{title="Deploying the system microservice to OpenShift"}

To deploy the ***system*** microservice, you must first package the microservice, then create and run an OpenShift build to produce runnable container images of the packaged microservice.

### Packaging the microservice

Ensure that you are in the ***start*** directory and run the following command to package the ***system*** microservice:


```bash
cd /home/project/guide-openliberty-operator-openshift/start
mvn clean package
```

### Building and pushing the image

Create a build template to configure how to build your container image.

Create the ***build.yaml*** template file in the ***start*** directory.

> Run the following touch command in your terminal
```bash
touch /home/project/guide-openliberty-operator-openshift/start/build.yaml
```


> Then, to open the build.yaml file in your IDE, select
> **File** > **Open** > guide-openliberty-operator-openshift/start/build.yaml, or click the following button

::openFile{path="/home/project/guide-openliberty-operator-openshift/start/build.yaml"}



```yaml
apiVersion: template.openshift.io/v1
kind: Template
metadata:
  name: "build-template"
  annotations:
    description: "Build template for the system service"
    tags: "build"
objects:
  - apiVersion: v1
    kind: ImageStream
    metadata:
      name: "system-imagestream"
      labels:
        name: "system"
  - apiVersion: v1
    kind: BuildConfig
    metadata:
      name: "system-buildconfig"
      labels:
        name: "system"
    spec:
      source:
        type: Binary
      strategy:
        type: Docker
      output:
        to:
          kind: ImageStreamTag
          name: "system-imagestream:1.0-SNAPSHOT"
```


Click the :fa-copy: **copy** button to copy the code and press `Ctrl+V` or `Command+V` in the IDE to add the code to the file.


The ***build.yaml*** template includes two objects. The ***ImageStream*** object provides an abstraction from the image in the image registry, which allows you to reference and tag the image. The image registry is the integrated internal OpenShift Container Registry.

The ***BuildConfig*** object defines a single build definition and any triggers that kickstart the build. The ***source*** spec defines the build input. In this case, the build inputs are your ***binary*** (local) files, which are streamed to OpenShift for the build. The uploaded files need to include the packaged ***WAR*** application binaries, which is why you needed to run the Maven commands. The template specifies a ***Docker*** strategy build, which invokes the ***docker build*** command, and creates a runnable container image of the microservice from the build input.

Run the following command to create the objects for the ***system*** microservice:

```bash
oc process -f build.yaml | oc create -f -
```

Next, run the following command to view the newly created ***ImageStream*** objects and the build configurations for the microservice:

```bash
oc get all -l name=system
```

Look for the following similar resources:

```
NAME                                                TYPE     FROM     LATEST
buildconfig.build.openshift.io/system-buildconfig   Docker   Binary   0

NAME                                                IMAGE REPOSITORY                                                                   TAGS           UPDATED
imagestream.image.openshift.io/system-imagestream   default-route-openshift-image-registry.apps-crc.testing/guide/system-imagestream
```   

Ensure that you are in the ***start*** directory and trigger the build by running the following command:

```bash
oc start-build system-buildconfig --from-dir=system/.
```

The local ***system*** directory is uploaded to OpenShift to be built into the Docker image. Run the following command to list the build and track its status:

```bash
oc get builds
```

Look for the output that is similar to the following example:

```
NAME                    TYPE     FROM             STATUS     STARTED
system-buildconfig-1    Docker   Binary@f24cb58   Running    45 seconds ago
```

You might need to wait some time until the build is complete. To check whether the build is complete, run the following command to view the build log until the ***Push successful*** message appears:

```bash
oc logs build/system-buildconfig-1
```

### Checking the image

During the build process, the image associated with the ***ImageStream*** object that you created earlier was pushed to the image registry and tagged. Run the following command to view the newly updated ***ImageStream*** object:

```bash
oc get imagestreams
```

Run the following command to get more details on the newly pushed image within the stream:

```bash
oc describe imagestream/system-imagestream
```

The following example shows part of the ***system-imagestream*** output:

```
Name:               system-imagestream
Namespace:          guide
Created:            2 minutes ago
Labels:             name=system
Annotations:        <none>
Image Repository:   default-route-openshift-image-registry.apps-crc.testing/guide/system-imagestream
Image Lookup:       local=false
Unique Images:      1
Tags:               1

...
```

Now you're ready to deploy the image.

### Deploying the image

You can configure the specifics of the Open Liberty Operator-controlled deployment with a YAML configuration file.

Create the ***deploy.yaml*** configuration file in the ***start*** directory.

> Run the following touch command in your terminal
```bash
touch /home/project/guide-openliberty-operator-openshift/start/deploy.yaml
```


> Then, to open the deploy.yaml file in your IDE, select
> **File** > **Open** > guide-openliberty-operator-openshift/start/deploy.yaml, or click the following button

::openFile{path="/home/project/guide-openliberty-operator-openshift/start/deploy.yaml"}



```yaml
apiVersion: apps.openliberty.io/v1beta2
kind: OpenLibertyApplication
metadata:
  name: system
  labels:
    name: system
spec:
  applicationImage: guide/system-imagestream:1.0-SNAPSHOT
  service:
    port: 9080
  expose: true
  env:
    - name: WLP_LOGGING_MESSAGE_FORMAT
      value: "json"
    - name: WLP_LOGGING_MESSAGE_SOURCE
      value: "message,trace,accessLog,ffdc,audit"
```



The ***deploy.yaml*** file is configured to deploy one ***OpenLibertyApplication*** resource, ***system***, which is controlled by the Open Liberty Operator.

The ***applicationImage*** parameter defines what container image is deployed as part of the ***OpenLibertyApplication*** CRD. This parameter follows the ***\<project-name\>/\<image-stream-name\>[:tag]*** format. The parameter can also point to an image hosted on an external registry, such as Docker Hub. The ***system*** microservice is configured to use the ***image*** created from the earlier build. 

One of the benefits of using ***ImageStream*** objects is that the operator redeploys the application when it detects that a new image is pushed. The ***env*** parameter is used to specify environment variables that are passed to the container at runtime.

Additionally, the microservice includes the ***service*** and ***expose*** parameters. The ***service.port*** parameter specifies which port is exposed by the container, allowing the microservice to be accessed from outside the container. To access the microservice from outside of the cluster, it must be exposed by setting the ***expose*** parameter to ***true***. After you expose the microservice, the Operator automatically creates and configures routes for external access to your microservice.


Run the following commands to update the **applicationImage** with the **pullSecret** and deploy the **system** microservice with the previously explained configuration:
```bash
sed -i 's=guide/system-imagestream:1.0-SNAPSHOT='"$SN_ICR_NAMESPACE"'/system-imagestream:1.0-SNAPSHOT\n  pullPolicy: Always\n  pullSecret: icr=g' deploy.yaml
oc apply -f deploy.yaml
```

Next, run the following command to view your newly created ***OpenLibertyApplications*** resources:

```bash
oc get OpenLibertyApplications
```

You can also replace ***OpenLibertyApplications*** with the shortname ***olapps***.

Look for output that is similar to the following example:

```
NAME      IMAGE                                    EXPOSED   RECONCILED   AGE
system    guide/system-imagestream:1.0-SNAPSHOT    true      True         10s
```

A ***RECONCILED*** state value of ***True*** indicates that the operator was able to successfully process the ***OpenLibertyApplications*** instances. Run the following command to view details of your microservice:

```bash
oc describe olapps/system
```

This example shows part of the ***olapps/system*** output:

```
Name:         system
Namespace:    guide
Labels:       app.kubernetes.io/part-of=system
              name=system
Annotations:  <none>
API Version:  apps.openliberty.io/v1beta2
Kind:         OpenLibertyApplication

...
```

::page{title="Accessing the microservice"}

To access the exposed ***system*** microservice, run the following command and make note of the ***HOST***:

```bash
oc get routes
```

Look for an output that is similar to the following example:

```
NAME     HOST/PORT                                                     PATH   SERVICES   PORT       TERMINATION   WILDCARD
system   system-guide.2886795274-80-kota02.environments.katacoda.com          system     9080-tcp                 None
```


Visit the microservice by going to the following URL: 
***http://[HOST]/system/properties***

Make sure to substitute the appropriate ***[HOST]*** value. For example, using the output from the command above, ***system-guide.2886795274-80-kota02.environments.katacoda.com*** is the ***HOST***. The following example shows this value substituted for ***HOST*** in the URL: ***http://system-guide.2886795274-80-kota02.environments.katacoda.com/system/properties***.

Or, you can run the following command to get the URL:
```bash
echo http://`oc get routes system -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}'`/system/properties
```

Then, hold the **CTRL** key and click on the URL in the terminal to visit the microservice.

When you’re done trying out the microservice, run following command to stop the microservice:
```bash
oc delete -f deploy.yaml
```

::page{title="Specifying optional parameters"}

You can also use the Open Liberty Operator to implement optional parameters in your application deployment by specifying the associated CRDs in your ***deploy.yaml*** file. For example, you can configure the [Kubernetes liveness, readiness and startup probes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-startup-probes/). Visit the [Open Liberty Operator user guide](https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty-operator/blob/main/doc/user-guide-v1beta2.adoc#configuration) to find all of the supported optional CRDs.

To configure the Kubernetes liveness, readiness and startup probes by using the Open Liberty Operator, specify the ***probes*** in your ***deploy.yaml*** file. The ***startup*** probe verifies whether deployed application is fully initialized before the liveness probe takes over. Then, the ***liveness*** probe determines whether the application is running and the ***readiness*** probe determines whether the application is ready to process requests. For more information about application health checks, see the [Checking the health of microservices on Kubernetes](https://openliberty.io/guides/kubernetes-microprofile-health.html) guide.

Replace the ***deploy.yaml*** configuration file.

      periodSeconds: 2
      timeoutSeconds: 10
```



The ***/health/started***, ***/health/live***, and ***/health/ready*** health check endpoints are already created for you. 


Run the following commands to update the **applicationImage** with the **pullSecret** and deploy the **system** microservice with the new configuration:
```bash
sed -i 's=guide/system-imagestream:1.0-SNAPSHOT='"$SN_ICR_NAMESPACE"'/system-imagestream:1.0-SNAPSHOT\n  pullPolicy: Always\n  pullSecret: icr=g' deploy.yaml
oc apply -f deploy.yaml
```
Run the following command to check status of the pods:
```bash
oc describe pods | grep health
```

Look for the following output to confirm that the health checks are successfully applied and working:

```
Liveness:   http-get http://:9080/health/live delay=30s timeout=10s period=2s #success=1 #failure=12
Readiness:  http-get http://:9080/health/ready delay=30s timeout=10s period=2s #success=1 #failure=12
Startup:    http-get http://:9080/health/started delay=30s timeout=10s period=2s #success=1 #failure=12
```

Run the following command to get the URL:
```bash
echo http://`oc get routes system -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}'`/system/properties
```

Then, hold the **CTRL** key and click on the URL in the terminal to visit the microservice.

::page{title="Tearing down the environment"}


When you no longer need your deployed microservice, you can delete all resources by running the following commands:

```bash
oc delete -f deploy.yaml
oc delete imagestream.image.openshift.io/system-imagestream
oc delete bc system-buildconfig
```
