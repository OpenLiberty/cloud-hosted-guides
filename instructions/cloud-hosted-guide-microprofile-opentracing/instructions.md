# **Welcome to the Enabling distributed tracing in microservices with Zipkin guide!**

Explore how to enable and customize tracing of JAX-RS and non-JAX-RS methods by using MicroProfile OpenTracing and the Zipkin tracing system.

In this guide, you will use a pre-configured environment that runs in containers on the cloud and includes everything that you need to complete the guide.

This panel contains the step-by-step guide instructions. You can customize these instructions by using the toolbar at the top of this panel. Move between steps by using either the arrows or the buttons at the bottom of this panel.

The other panel displays the IDE that you will use to create files, edit the code, and run commands. This IDE is based on Visual Studio Code. It includes pre-installed tools and a built-in terminal.




# **What you'll learn**

You'll learn how to enable automatic tracing for JAX-RS methods and how to create custom tracers
for non-JAX-RS methods by using MicroProfile OpenTracing.

OpenTracing is a standard API for instrumenting microservices for distributed tracing.
Distributed tracing helps troubleshoot microservices by examining and logging requests
as they propagate through a distributed system.
Distributed tracing allows developers to tackle the otherwise difficult task of debugging these requests.
Without a distributed tracing system in place, analyzing the workflows of operations becomes difficult.
Pinpointing when and where a request is received and when responses are sent becomes difficult.

MicroProfile OpenTracing enables distributed tracing in microservices without adding any explicit
distributed tracing code to the application. Note that the MicroProfile OpenTracing specification does
not address the problem of defining, implementing, or configuring the underlying distributed tracing
system. Rather, the specification makes it easier to instrument services with distributed tracing given
an existing distributed tracing system.

You'll configure the provided **inventory** and **system** services to use distributed tracing with
MicroProfile OpenTracing. You'll run these services in two separate JVMs made of two server instances
to demonstrate tracing in a distributed environment. If all the components were to run on a single
server, then any logging software would do the trick.

# **Getting started**

To open a new command-line session,
select **Terminal** > **New Terminal** from the menu of the IDE.

Run the following command to navigate to the **/home/project** directory:

```
cd /home/project
```
{: codeblock}

The fastest way to work through this guide is to clone the [Git repository](https://github.com/openliberty/guide-microprofile-opentracing.git) and use the projects that are provided inside:

```
git clone https://github.com/openliberty/guide-microprofile-opentracing.git
cd guide-microprofile-opentracing
```
{: codeblock}


The **start** directory contains the starting project that you will build upon.

The **finish** directory contains the finished project that you will build.

For this guide, Zipkin is used as the distributed tracing system. You can find the installation instructions
for Zipkin at the Zipkin [quickstart page](https://zipkin.io/pages/quickstart.html). You're not required
to use Zipkin. You may choose to use another tracing system.
However, this guide is written using Zipkin. If you use a different tracing system, the required instructions may differ.


Start Zipkin by running the following command:
```
docker run -d --name zipkin -p 9411:9411 openzipkin/zipkin
```
{: codeblock}

Before you continue, make sure your Zipkin server is up and running.
Select **Launch Application** from the menu of the IDE and 
type **9411** to specify the port number for the Zipkin service. Click the **OK** button. 
Zipkin can also be found at the **`https://accountname-9411.theiadocker-4.proxy.cognitiveclass.ai`** URL, 
where **accountname** is your account name.

<br/>
### **Try what you'll build**

The **finish** directory in the root directory of this guide contains two services that are configured
to use MicroProfile OpenTracing. Give them a try before you continue.

To try out the services, navigate to the **finish** directory and run the Maven **install** phase to build the services
```
cd finish
mvn install
```
{: codeblock}


Then, run the Maven **liberty:start-server** goal to start them in two Open Liberty servers:
```
mvn liberty:start-server
```
{: codeblock}



Make sure your Zipkin server is running and run the following curl command:
```
curl http://localhost:9081/inventory/systems/localhost
```
{: codeblock}

When you make this curl request, you make two HTTP GET requests, one to the **system** service and 
one to the **inventory** service. 
Because tracing is configured for both these requests, a new trace is recorded in Zipkin.
Visit the **`https://accountname-9411.theiadocker-4.proxy.cognitiveclass.ai`** URL.
Run an empty query and sort the traces by latest start time first. 

Verify that the new trace contains three spans with the following names:

* **get:io.openliberty.guides.inventory.inventoryresource.getpropertiesforhost**
* **get:io.openliberty.guides.system.systemresource.getproperties**
* **add() span**

You can inspect each span by clicking it to reveal more detailed information, such as the time
at which the request was received and the time at which a response was sent back.

If you examine the other traces, you might notice a red trace entry, 
which indicates the span caught an error. 
In this case, one of the tests accesses the **/inventory/systems/badhostname**
endpoint, which is invalid, so an error is thrown. This behavior is expected.

When you're done checking out the services, stop both Open Liberty servers using the Maven
**liberty:stop-server** goal:

```
mvn liberty:stop-server
```
{: codeblock}



# **Running the services**

Navigate to the **start** directory to begin.

You'll need to start the services to see basic traces appear in Zipkin. 
So, before you proceed, build and start the provided **system** and **inventory**
services in the starting project by running the Maven **install** goal:

```
mvn install
```
{: codeblock}


Then, run the **liberty:start-server** goal:

```
mvn liberty:start-server
```
{: codeblock}



When the servers start, you can access the **system** service by running the following curl command:
```
curl http://localhost:9080/system/properties
```
{: codeblock}

and access the **inventory** service by running the following curl command:
```
curl http://localhost:9081/inventory/systems
```
{: codeblock}


# **Existing Tracer implementation**

To collect traces across your systems, you need to implement the OpenTracing **Tracer**
interface. For this guide, you can access a bare-bones **Tracer** implementation for
the Zipkin server in the form of a user feature for Open Liberty.

This feature is already configured for you in your **pom.xml** and **server.xml** files. 
It's automatically downloaded and installed into each service when you run a Maven build. 
You can find the **opentracingZipkin** feature enabled in your **server.xml** file.

The **download-maven-plugin** Maven plug-in in your **pom.xml**
downloads and installs the **opentracingZipkin** feature.

If you want to install this feature yourself, see
[Enabling distributed tracing](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/was-liberty/base?topic=environment-enabling-distributed-tracing)
in IBM Documentation.




# **Enabling distributed tracing**

The MicroProfile OpenTracing feature enables tracing of all JAX-RS methods by default.
To further control and customize these traces, use the **@Traced** annotation to enable and disable
tracing of particular methods. You can also inject a custom **Tracer** object to create and customize spans.

<br/>
### **Enabling distributed tracing without code instrumentation**

Because tracing is enabled by default for all JAX-RS methods, you need to enable only the
**mpOpenTracing** feature and the **usr:opentracingZipkin**
user feature in the **server.xml** file to see some basic traces in Zipkin.

Both of these features are already enabled in the **inventory** and **system** configuration files.

Make sure your services are running. 
Then, point your browser to any of their endpoints and check your Zipkin server for traces.


<br/>
### **Enabling explicit distributed tracing**

The **@Traced** annotation defines explicit span creation for specific classes and methods.
If you place the annotation on a class, then it's automatically applied to all methods within that class.
If you place the annotation on a method, then it overrides the class annotation if one exists.

Enable tracing of the **list()** non-JAX-RS method by adding the
**@Traced** annotation to the method.

Replace the **InventoryManager** class.

package io.openliberty.guides.inventory;

import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Collections;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.Properties;
import javax.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;
import javax.inject.Inject;

import io.openliberty.guides.inventory.client.SystemClient;
import io.openliberty.guides.inventory.model.InventoryList;
import io.openliberty.guides.inventory.model.SystemData;
import io.opentracing.Scope;
import io.opentracing.Span;
import io.opentracing.Tracer;

import org.eclipse.microprofile.opentracing.Traced;

@ApplicationScoped
public class InventoryManager {

    private List<SystemData> systems = Collections.synchronizedList(new ArrayList<>());
    private SystemClient systemClient = new SystemClient();

    public Properties get(String hostname) {
        systemClient.init(hostname, 9080);
        Properties properties = systemClient.getProperties();
        return properties;
    }

    public void add(String hostname, Properties systemProps) {
        Properties props = new Properties();
        props.setProperty("os.name", systemProps.getProperty("os.name"));
        props.setProperty("user.name", systemProps.getProperty("user.name"));

        SystemData system = new SystemData(hostname, props);
    }

    @Traced(value = true, operationName = "InventoryManager.list")
    public InventoryList list() {
        return new InventoryList(systems);
    }
}
```
{: codeblock}


The **@Traced** annotation can be configured with the following two parameters:

* The **value=[true|false]** parameter indicates whether a particular class or method is traced. 
For example, while all JAX-RS methods are traced by default,
you can disable their tracing by using the **@Traced(false)** annotation. 
This parameter is set to **true** by default.
* The **operationName=<Span name>** parameter indicates the name of the span that is assigned to the
particular method that is traced. If you omit this parameter, the span will be named with the following
form: **`<package name>.<class name>.<method name>`**. If you use this parameter at a class level, then
all methods within that class will have the same span name unless they're explicitly overridden by
another **@Traced** annotation.

Next, run the following command from the **start** directory to recompile your services. 
```
mvn compile
```
{: codeblock}



Run the following curl command, check your Zipkin server, and sort the traces by newest first:
```
curl http://localhost:9081/inventory/systems
```
{: codeblock}

Look for a new trace record that is two spans long with one span for the 
**listContents()** JAX-RS method in the **InventoryResource**
class and another span for the **list()** method in the **InventoryManager** class. 
Verify that these spans have the following names:

* **get:io.openliberty.guides.inventory.inventoryresource.listcontents**
* **inventorymanager.list**

Now, disable tracing on the **InventoryResource** class by setting **@Traced(false)**
on the **listContents()** JAX-RS method.

Replace the **InventoryResource** class.

import javax.ws.rs.GET;
import javax.ws.rs.Path;
import javax.ws.rs.PathParam;

public class InventoryResource {

    @Inject InventoryManager manager;

    @GET
    @Path("/{hostname}")
    @Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
    public Response getPropertiesForHost(@PathParam("hostname") String hostname) {
        Properties props = manager.get(hostname);
        if (props == null) {
            return Response.status(Response.Status.NOT_FOUND)
                           .entity("{ \"error\" : \"Unknown hostname or the system service " 
                           + "may not be running on " + hostname + "\" }")
                           .build();
        }
        manager.add(hostname, props);
        return Response.ok(props).build();
    }

    @Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
    public InventoryList listContents() {
        return manager.list();
    }
}
```
{: codeblock}


Again, run the **mvn compile** command from the **start** directory to recompile your services:
```
mvn compile
```
{: codeblock}




Run the following curl command again, check your Zipkin server, and sort the traces by newest first:
```
curl http://localhost:9081/inventory/systems
```
{: codeblock}

Look for a new trace record that is just one span long for the remaining **list()** 
method in the **InventoryManager** class. 
Verify that this span has the following name:

* **inventorymanager.list**



<br/>
### **Injecting a custom Tracer object**

The MicroProfile OpenTracing specification also makes the underlying OpenTracing **Tracer** instance
available. The configured **Tracer** is accessed by injecting it into a bean by using the
**@Inject** annotation from the Contexts and Dependency Injections API.

After injecting it, the **Tracer** will be used to build a **Span**.
The **Span** will be activated and used in a **Scope**.

Replace the **InventoryManager** class.

> **File** > **Open** > guide-microprofile-opentracing/start/inventory/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/inventory/InventoryManager.java




```
package io.openliberty.guides.inventory;

import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Collections;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.Properties;
import javax.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;
import javax.inject.Inject;

import io.openliberty.guides.inventory.client.SystemClient;
import io.openliberty.guides.inventory.model.InventoryList;
import io.openliberty.guides.inventory.model.SystemData;
import io.opentracing.Scope;
import io.opentracing.Span;
import io.opentracing.Tracer;

import org.eclipse.microprofile.opentracing.Traced;

@ApplicationScoped
public class InventoryManager {

    private List<SystemData> systems = Collections.synchronizedList(new ArrayList<>());
    private SystemClient systemClient = new SystemClient();
    @Inject Tracer tracer;

    public Properties get(String hostname) {
        systemClient.init(hostname, 9080);
        Properties properties = systemClient.getProperties();
        return properties;
    }

    public void add(String hostname, Properties systemProps) {
        Properties props = new Properties();
        props.setProperty("os.name", systemProps.getProperty("os.name"));
        props.setProperty("user.name", systemProps.getProperty("user.name"));

        SystemData system = new SystemData(hostname, props);
        if (!systems.contains(system)) {
            Span span = tracer.buildSpan("add() Span").start();
            try (Scope childScope = tracer.scopeManager()
                                          .activate(span)
                ) {
                systems.add(system);
            } finally {
                span.finish();
            }
        }
    }

    @Traced(value = true, operationName = "InventoryManager.list")
    public InventoryList list() {
        return new InventoryList(systems);
    }
}
```
{: codeblock}


The **Scope** is used in a **try** block.
The **try** block that you see here is called a **try-with-resources** statement, 
meaning that the **Scope** object is closed at the end of the statement.
Defining custom spans inside such statements is a good practice.
Otherwise, any exceptions that are thrown before the span is closed will leak the active span.
The **finish()** method sets the ending timestamp and records the span.

Next, run the following command from the **start** directory to recompile your services. 
```
mvn compile
```
{: codeblock}




Run the following curl command, check your Zipkin server, and sort the traces by newest first:
```
curl http://localhost:9081/inventory/systems/localhost
```
{: codeblock}

Look for two new trace records, one for the **system** service and one for the **inventory** service. The **system** trace 
contains one span for the **getProperties()** method in the **SystemResource** class. 
The **inventory** trace contains two spans. 
The first span is for the **getPropertiesForHost()** method in the 
**InventoryResource** class. The second span is the custom span that you created around the **add()** call. 
Verify that all of these spans have the following names:

The **system** trace:

* **get:io.openliberty.guides.system.systemresource.getproperties**

The **inventory** trace:

* **get:io.openliberty.guides.inventory.inventoryresource.getpropertiesforhost**
* **add() span**

This simple example shows what you can do with the injected **Tracer** object. More configuration
options are available, including setting a timestamp for when a span was created and destroyed.
However, these options require an implementation of their own, which does not come as a part of the Zipkin
user feature that is provided. In a real-world scenario, implement all the OpenTracing interfaces that
you consider necessary, which might include the **SpanBuilder** interface. You can use this interface for span
creation and customization, including setting timestamps.





# **Testing the services**

No automated tests are provided to verify the correctness of the traces. Manually verify these traces
by viewing them on the Zipkin server.

A few tests are included for you to test the basic functionality of the services. If a test failure
occurs, then you might have introduced a bug into the code. These tests will run automatically as a
part of the Maven build process when you run the **mvn install** command. You can also run these tests
separately from the build by using the **mvn verify** command, but first make sure the servers are
stopped.

When you're done checking out the services, stop the server by using the Maven
**liberty:stop-server** goal:

```
mvn liberty:stop-server
```
{: codeblock}


Stop the Zipkin service by running the following command:
```
docker stop zipkin
```
{: codeblock}
