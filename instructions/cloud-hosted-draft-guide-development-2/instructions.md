# **Welcome to the Consuming a RESTful web service with Angular guide!**



In this guide, you will use a pre-configured environment that runs in containers on the cloud and includes everything that you need to complete the guide.

This panel contains the step-by-step guide instructions. You can customize these instructions by using the toolbar at the top of this panel. Move between steps by using either the arrows or the buttons at the bottom of this panel.

The other panel displays the IDE that you will use to create files, edit the code, and run commands. This IDE is based on Visual Studio Code. It includes pre-installed tools and a built-in terminal.


Explore how to access a simple RESTful web service and consume its resources with Angular in Open
Liberty.


# **What you'll learn**

[Angular](https://angular.io) is a framework for creating interactive web applications.
Angular applications are written in HTML, CSS, and
[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org), a variant of JavaScript. Angular helps you
create responsive and intuitive applications that download once and run as a single web
page. Consuming REST services with your Angular application allows you to request
only the data and operations that you need, minimizing loading times.

You will learn how to access a REST service and deserialize the returned JSON that
contains a list of artists and their albums by using an Angular service and the Angular
HTTP Client. You will then present this data using an Angular component.

The REST service that provides the artists and albums resource was written for you in
advance and responds with the **artists.json**.

The Angular application was created and configured for you in the **frontend**
directory. It contains the default starter application. There are many files that make
up an Angular application, but you only need to edit a few to consume the REST
service and display its data.

Angular applications must be compiled before they can be used. The Angular compilation
step was configured as part of the Maven build. You can use the **start** folder of
this guide as a template for getting started with your own applications built on
Angular and Open Liberty.



You will implement an Angular client that consumes this JSON and displays its contents.

To learn more about REST services and how you can write them, see
[Creating a RESTful web service](https://openliberty.io/guides/rest-intro.html).


# **Getting started**

To open a new command-line session,
select **Terminal** > **New Terminal** from the menu of the IDE.

Run the following command to navigate to the **/home/project** directory:

```
cd /home/project
```
{: codeblock}

The fastest way to work through this guide is to clone the [Git repository](https://github.com/openliberty/guide-rest-client-angular.git) and use the projects that are provided inside:

```
git clone https://github.com/openliberty/guide-rest-client-angular.git
cd guide-rest-client-angular
```
{: codeblock}


The **start** directory contains the starting project that you will build upon.

The **finish** directory contains the finished project that you will build.

<br/>
### **Try what you'll build**

The **finish** directory in the root of this guide contains the finished application. Give it a try before you proceed.

To try out the application, first go to the **finish** directory and run the following
Maven goal to build the application and deploy it to Open Liberty:

```
cd finish
mvn liberty:run
```
{: codeblock}


After you see the following message, your application server is ready:

```
The defaultServer server is ready to run a smarter planet.
```


Select **Launch Application** from the menu of the IDE, 
type in **9090** to specify the port number for the microservice, and click the **OK** button. 
You're redirected to a URL similar to **`https://accountname-9090.theiadocker-4.proxy.cognitiveclass.ai/app/`**, 
where **accountname** is your account name. You will see the following output:



```
foo wrote 2 albums:
    Album titled *album_one* by *foo* contains *12* tracks
    Album tilted *album_two* by *foo* contains *15* tracks
bar wrote 1 albums:
    Album titled *foo walks into a bar* by *bar* contains *12* tracks
dj wrote 0 albums:
```

After you are finished checking out the application, stop the Open Liberty server by pressing **CTRL+C**
in the command-line session where you ran the server. Alternatively, you can run the **liberty:stop** goal
from the **finish** directory in another shell session:

```
mvn liberty:stop
```
{: codeblock}



# **Starting the service**

Before you begin the implementation, start the provided REST service so that
the artist JSON is available to you.

Navigate to the **start** directory to begin.

When you run Open Liberty in development mode, known as dev mode, the server listens for file changes and automatically recompiles and 
deploys your updates whenever you save a new change. Run the following goal to start Open Liberty in dev mode:

```
mvn liberty:dev
```
{: codeblock}


After you see the following message, your application server in dev mode is ready:

```
**************************************************************
*    Liberty is running in dev mode.
```

Dev mode holds your command-line session to listen for file changes. Open another command-line session to continue, 
or open the project in your editor.


Once your application is up and running, open another command-line session by selecting **Terminal** > **New Terminal** 
from the menu of the IDE. Then use the following command to get the URL.
Open your browser and check out your artist JSON by going to the URL that the command returns.
```
echo http://${USERNAME}-9080.$(echo $TOOL_DOMAIN | sed 's/\.labs\./.proxy./g')/artists
```
{: codeblock} 


# **Project configuration**

The front end of your application uses Node.js to execute your Angular code. The Maven project is configured for you to install Node.js and produce the production files, which are copied to the web content of your application.

Node.js is server-side JavaScript runtime that is used for developing networking applications. Its convenient package manager, [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), is used to execute the Angular scripts found in the **package.json** file. To learn more about Node.js, see the official [Node.js documentation](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/).

The **frontend-maven-plugin** is used to **install** the dependencies listed in your **package.json** file from the npm registry into a folder called **`node_modules`**. The **`node_modules`** folder is found in your **working** directory. Then, the configuration **produces** the production files to the **src/main/frontend/src/app** directory. 

The **src/main/frontend/src/angular.json** file is defined so that the production build is copied into the web content of your application.



# **Creating the root Angular module**

Your application needs a way to communicate with and retrieve resources from RESTful web services. 
In this case, the provided Angular application needs to communicate with the
artists service to retrieve the artists JSON. While there are various ways to perform
this task, Angular contains a built-in **HttpClientModule** that you can use.

Angular applications consist of modules, which are groups of classes that
perform specific functions. The Angular framework provides its own modules
for applications to use. One of these modules, the HTTP Client module, includes
convenience classes that make it easier and quicker for you to consume a RESTful API
from your application.

You will create the module that organizes your application, which is called the root module. 
The root module includes the Angular HTTP Client module.


Create the **app.module.ts** file.

> Run the following touch command in your terminal
```
touch /home/project/guide-rest-client-angular/start/src/main/frontend/src/app/app.module.ts
```
{: codeblock}


> Then from the menu of the IDE, select **File** > **Open** > guide-rest-client-angular/start/src/main/frontend/src/app/app.module.ts




```
import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { HttpClientModule } from '@angular/common/http';
import { AppComponent } from './app.component';

@NgModule({
  declarations: [
    AppComponent
  ],
  imports: [
    BrowserModule,
    HttpClientModule,
  ],
  providers: [],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
export class AppModule { }
```
{: codeblock}


The **HttpClientModule** imports the class into the file.
By using the **@NgModule** tag, you can declare a module and organize 
your dependencies within the Angular framework. The **imports** array is a declaration array that imports the **HttpClientModule** so that you can use the HTTP Client module in your application.


# **Creating the Angular service to fetch data**

You need to create the component that is used in the application to acquire and display
data from the REST API. The component file contains two classes: the service, which
handles data access, and the component itself, which handles the presentation of the
data.

Services are classes in Angular that are designed to share their functionality across
entire applications. A good service performs only one function, and it performs this
function well. In this case, the **ArtistsService** class requests artists data from the
REST service.


Create the **app.component.ts** file.

> Run the following touch command in your terminal
```
touch /home/project/guide-rest-client-angular/start/src/main/frontend/src/app/app.component.ts
```
{: codeblock}


> Then from the menu of the IDE, select **File** > **Open** > guide-rest-client-angular/start/src/main/frontend/src/app/app.component.ts




```
import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
import { HttpClient } from '@angular/common/http';
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';

@Injectable()
export class ArtistsService {
  constructor(private http: HttpClient) { }

  private static ARTISTS_URL = '/artists';

  async fetchArtists() {
    try {
      const data: any = await this.http.get(ArtistsService.ARTISTS_URL).toPromise();
      return data;
    } catch (error) {
      console.error(**Error occurred: ${error}**);
    }
  }
}

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  templateUrl: './app.component.html',
  providers: [ ArtistsService ],
  styleUrls: ['./app.component.css']
})
export class AppComponent implements OnInit {
  artists: any[] = [];

  constructor(private artistsService: ArtistsService) { }

  ngOnInit() {
    this.artistsService.fetchArtists().then(data => {
      this.artists = data;
    });
  }
}
```
{: codeblock}


The file imports the **HttpClient** class and the
**Injectable** decorator.

The **ArtistsService** class is defined. While it shares the
file of the component class **AppComponent**, it can also be
defined in its own file. The class is annotated by **@Injectable**
so instances of it can be provided to other classes anywhere in the application.

The class injects an instance of the **HttpClient** class,
which it uses to request data from the REST API. It contains the
**`ARTISTS_URL`** constant, which points to the API endpoint it
requests data from. The URL does not contain a host name because the artists API
endpoint is accessible from the same host as the Angular application. You can send
requests to external APIs by specifying the full URL. Finally, it implements a
**fetchArtists()** method that makes the request and returns
the result.

To obtain the data for display on the page, the
**fetchArtists()** method tries to use the injected
**http** instance to perform a
**GET** HTTP request to the **`ARTISTS_URL`** constant. If successful, it
returns the result. If an error occurs, it prints the error message to the console.

The **fetchArtists()** method uses a feature of JavaScript
called **async**/
**await** to make requests and
receive responses without preventing the application from working while it waits. For
the result of the
**HttpClient.get()** method to
be compatible with this feature, it must be converted to a Promise by invoking its
**toPromise()** method. A
Promise is how JavaScript represents the state of an asynchronous operation. If you
want to learn more, check out [](https://promisejs.org) for an introduction.


# **Defining the component to consume the service**

Components are the basic building blocks of Angular application user interfaces.
Components are made up of a TypeScript class annotated with the
**@Component** annotation and the HTML template file (specified by
**templateUrl**) and CSS style files (specified by
**styleUrls**.)

Update the **AppComponent** class to use the artists service
to fetch the artists data and save it so the component can display it.


Update the **app.component.ts** file.

> From the menu of the IDE, select 
> **File** > **Open** > guide-rest-client-angular/start/src/main/frontend/src/app/app.component.ts




```
import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
import { HttpClient } from '@angular/common/http';
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';

@Injectable()
export class ArtistsService {
  constructor(private http: HttpClient) { }

  private static ARTISTS_URL = '/artists';

  async fetchArtists() {
    try {
      const data: any = await this.http.get(ArtistsService.ARTISTS_URL).toPromise();
      return data;
    } catch (error) {
      console.error(**Error occurred: ${error}**);
    }
  }
}

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  templateUrl: './app.component.html',
  providers: [ ArtistsService ],
  styleUrls: ['./app.component.css']
})
export class AppComponent implements OnInit {
  artists: any[] = [];

  constructor(private artistsService: ArtistsService) { }

  ngOnInit() {
    this.artistsService.fetchArtists().then(data => {
      this.artists = data;
    });
  }
}
```
{: codeblock}


Replace the entire **AppComponent** class along with the
**@Component** annotation. Add
**OnInit** to the list of imported classes at
the top.

The **providers** property on the
**@Component** annotation indicates that this component provides the
**ArtistsService** to other classes in the application.

**AppComponent** implements **OnInit**,
which is a special interface called a lifecycle hook. When Angular displays, updates,
or removes a component, it calls a specific function, the lifecycle hook, on the
component so the component can run code in response to this event. This component
responds to the **OnInit** event via the
**ngOnInit** method, which fetches and populates the component's
template with data when it is initialized for display. The file imports the
**OnInit** interface from the
**@angular/core** package.

**artists** is a class member of type **any[]** that starts out
as an empty array. It holds the artists retrieved from the service so the template can
display them.

An instance of the **ArtistsService** class is
injected into the constructor and is accessible by any function that is defined in the
class. The **ngOnInit** function uses the
**artistsService** instance to request the artists data.
Since the **fetchArtists()** method is an **async** function,
it returns a Promise. To retrieve the data from the request,
**ngOnInit** calls the **then()** method on the
Promise which takes in the data and stores it to the
**artists** class member.


# **Creating the Angular component template**

Now that you have a service to fetch the data and a component to store it in, you
will create a template to specify how the data will be displayed on the page. When you
visit the page in the browser, the component populates the template to display
the artists data with formatting.

Create the **app.component.html** file.

> Run the following touch command in your terminal
```
touch /home/project/guide-rest-client-angular/start/src/main/frontend/src/app/app.component.html
```
{: codeblock}


> Then from the menu of the IDE, select **File** > **Open** > guide-rest-client-angular/start/src/main/frontend/src/app/app.component.html




```
<div *ngFor="let artist of artists">
  <p>{{ artist.name }} wrote {{ artist.albums.length }} albums: </p>
  <!-- tag::albumDiv[] -->
  <div *ngFor="let album of artist.albums">
    <p style="text-indent: 20px">
      Album titled <b>{{ album.title }}</b> by
                   <b>{{ album.artist }}</b> contains
                   <b>{{ album.ntracks }}</b> tracks
    </p>
  </div>
</div>
```
{: codeblock}



The template contains a **div** element that is enumerated by using the
**ngFor** directive. The **artist** variable is bound to the **artists** member of the
component. The **div** element itself and all elements contained within it are repeated for
each artist, and the **{{ artist.name }}**
and **{{ artist.albums.length }}**
placeholders are populated with the information from each artist. The same strategy is
used to display each **album** by each artist.


# **Building the front end**

The Open Liberty server is already started, and the REST service is running. In a new 
command-line session, build the front end by running the following command:

```
mvn generate-resources
```
{: codeblock}


You can rebuild the front end at any time with the **generate-resources** Maven goal. 
Any local changes to your TypeScript or HTML are picked up when you build the front end.


Select **Launch Application** from the menu of the IDE, 
type in **9090** to specify the port number for the microservice, and click the **OK** button. 
You're redirected to a URL similar to **`https://accountname-9090.theiadocker-4.proxy.cognitiveclass.ai/app/`**, 
where **accountname** is your account name. You will see the following output:

```
foo wrote 2 albums:
    Album titled *album_one* by *foo* contains *12* tracks
    Album tilted *album_two* by *foo* contains *15* tracks
bar wrote 1 albums:
    Album titled *foo walks into a bar* by *bar* contains *12* tracks
dj wrote 0 albums:
```

If you use the **curl** command to access the web application root URL,
you see only the application root page in HTML. The Angular framework
uses JavaScript to render the HTML to display the application data.
A web browser runs JavaScript, and the **curl** command doesn't.


# **Testing the Angular client**

No explicit code directly uses the consumed artist JSON, so you don't need to write
any test cases.


Whenever you change and build your Angular implementation the changes will be reflected automatically
at the URL for the launched application.

When you are done checking the application root, exit development mode by
pressing **CTRL+C** in the command-line session where you ran the server,
or by typing **q** and then pressing the **enter/return** key.

Although the Angular application that this guide shows you how to build is simple,
when you build more complex Angular applications, testing becomes a crucial part
of your development lifecycle. If you need to write test cases, follow the official
unit testing and end-to-end testing documentation on the
[official Angular page](https://angular.io/guide/testing).
