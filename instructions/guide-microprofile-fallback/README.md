## Building fault-tolerant microservices with the **@Fallback** annotation

### What you’ll learn

You will learn how to use MicroProfile (MP) Fault Tolerance to build resilient microservices that reduce the impact from failure and ensure continued operation of services.

MP Fault Tolerance provides a simple and flexible solution to build fault-tolerant microservices. Fault tolerance leverages different strategies to guide the execution and result of logic. As stated in the MicroProfile website, retry policies, bulkheads, and circuit breakers are popular concepts in this area. They dictate whether and when executions take place, and fallbacks offer an alternative result when an execution does not complete successfully.

The application that you will be working with is an **inventory** service, which collects, stores, and returns the system properties. It uses the **system** service to retrieve the system properties for a particular host. You will add fault tolerance to the **inventory** service so that it reacts accordingly when the **system** service is unavailable.

You will use the **@Fallback** annotations from the MicroProfile Fault Tolerance specification to define criteria for when to provide an alternative solution for a failed execution.

You will also see the application metrics for the fault tolerance methods that are automatically enabled when you add the MicroProfile Metrics feature to the server.

## Getting Started

The fastest way to work through this guide is to clone the Git repository and use the projects that are provided inside:

`git clone https://github.com/openliberty/guide-microprofile-fallback.git`

Navigate into project

`cd guide-microprofile-fallback`

The **start** directory contains the starting project that you will build upon.

The **finish** directory contains the finished project that you will build.

If you want to dive straight into it, head to **Enable Fault Tolerance** part

### Try what you'll build 

The **finish** directory in the root of this guide contains the finished implementation for the application. Give it a try before you proceed with building your own.

To try out the application, go to the **finish** directory and run the following Maven goal to build the application and deploy it to Open Liberty:

`cd finish`

`mvn liberty:run`

Access the **inventory** service with a localhost hostname. You see the system properties for this host. When you visit this URL, some of these system properties, such as the OS name and user name, are automatically stored in the inventory. Open up a new terminal by clicking on the window icon in the top right corner of the terminal and run the following command: 

`curl http://localhost:9080/inventory/systems/localhost`

Update the **CustomConfigSource** configuration file.

Navigate to **resources/CustomConfigSource.json** and Change the **io_openliberty_guides_system_inMaintenance** property from  **false** to **true**.

> [File -> Open] guide-microprofile-fallback/finish/resources 


```json
{"config_ordinal":500,
"io_openliberty_guides_system_inMaintenance":true}
```

Save the file [CMD + S]

The fallback mechanism is triggered because the system service is now in maintenance. You see the cached properties for this localhost.

`curl http://localhost:9080/inventory/systems/localhost`

The folloing output should be:

```
{"os.name":"Linux","user.name":"theia"}
```

Once you have finished checking it out, change **io_openliberty_guides_system_inMaintenance** from **true** to **false** to set this condition back to its original value.

Stop the Open Liberty server by pressing **CTRL+C** in the shell session where you ran the server. 

## Enabling fault tolerance

Navigate to the **start** directory to begin from the **Open Liberty Server Terminal**.

`cd ../start`

Start Open Liberty in development mode, which starts the Open Liberty server and listens for file changes:

`mvn liberty:dev`

The MicroProfile Fault Tolerance API is included in the MicroProfile dependency that is specified in your **pom.xml** file. Look for the dependency with the **microprofile** artifact ID. This dependency provides a library that allows you to use fault tolerance policies in your microservices.

You can also find the **mpFaultTolerance** feature in your **src/main/liberty/config/server.xml** server configuration, which turns on MicroProfile Fault Tolerance capabilities in Open Liberty.

To easily work through this guide, the two provided microservices are set up to run on the same server. To simulate the availability of the services and then to enable fault tolerance, dynamic configuration with MicroProfile Configuration is used so that you can easily take one service or the other down for maintenance. If you want to learn more about setting up dynamic configuration, see [Configuring microservices](https://openliberty.io/guides/microprofile-config.html).

The following two steps set up the dynamic configuration on the **system** service and its client. You can move on to the next section, which adds the fallback mechanism on the **inventory** service.

First, the **src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/system/SystemResource.java** file has the **isInMaintenance()** condition, which determines that the system properties are returned only if you set the **io_openliberty_guides_system_inMaintenance** configuration property to **false** in the **CustomConfigSource** file. Otherwise, the service returns a **Status.SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE** message, which makes it unavailable.

Next, the **src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/inventory/client/SystemClient.java** file makes a request to the **system** service through the MicroProfile Rest Client API. If you want to learn more about MicroProfile Rest Client, you can follow the [Consuming RESTful services with template interfaces guide](https://openliberty.io/guides/microprofile-rest-client.html). The **system** service as described in the **SystemResource.java** file may return a **Status.SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE** message, which is a 503 status code. This code indicates that the server being called is unable to handle the request because of a temporary overload or scheduled maintenance, which would likely be alleviated after some delay. To simulate that the system is unavailable, an **IOException** is thrown.

The InventoryManager class calls the getProperties() method in the SystemClient.java class. You will look into the InventoryManager class in more detail in the next section.

## Adding the @Fallback annotation

The **inventory** service is now able to recognize that the **system** service was taken down for maintenance. An IOException is thrown to simulate the **system** service is unavailable. Now, set a fallback method to deal with this failure.

Replace the **InventoryManager** class.

> [File -> Open] guide-microprofile-fallback/start/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/inventory/InventoryManager.java

```java
package io.openliberty.guides.inventory;

import java.io.IOException;
import java.util.Properties;
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Collections;
import java.util.List;
import javax.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;
import org.eclipse.microprofile.faulttolerance.Fallback;
import io.openliberty.guides.inventory.model.*;

@ApplicationScoped
public class InventoryManager {

  private List<SystemData> systems = Collections.synchronizedList(new ArrayList<>());
  private InventoryUtils invUtils = new InventoryUtils();

  @Fallback(fallbackMethod = "fallbackForGet")
  public Properties get(String hostname) throws IOException {
    return invUtils.getProperties(hostname);
  }

  public Properties fallbackForGet(String hostname) {
    Properties properties = findHost(hostname);
    if (properties == null) {
      Properties msgProp = new Properties();
      msgProp.setProperty(hostname, "System is not found in the inventory");
      return msgProp;
    }
    return properties;
  }

  public void add(String hostname, Properties systemProps) {
    Properties props = new Properties();
    props.setProperty("os.name", systemProps.getProperty("os.name"));
    props.setProperty("user.name", systemProps.getProperty("user.name"));

    SystemData system = new SystemData(hostname, props);
    if (!systems.contains(system)) {
      systems.add(system);
    }
  }

  public InventoryList list() {
    return new InventoryList(systems);
  }

  private Properties findHost(String hostname) {
    for (SystemData system : systems) {
      if (system.getHostname().equals(hostname)) {
        return system.getProperties();
      }
    }
    return null;
  }
}
```

The **@Fallback** annotation dictates a method to call when the original method encounters a failed execution. In this example, use the **fallbackForGet()** method.

The **fallbackForGet()** method, which is the designated fallback method for the original **get()** method, checks to see if the system’s properties exist in the inventory. If the system properties entry is not found in the inventory, the method prints out a warning message in the browser. Otherwise, this method returns the cached property values from the inventory.

You successfully set up your microservice to have fault tolerance capability.

## Enabling metrics for the fault tolerance methods

MicroProfile Fault Tolerance integrates with MicroProfile Metrics to provide metrics for the annotated fault tolerance methods. When both the **mpFaultTolerance** and the **mpMetrics** features are included in the **server.xml** configuration file, the **@Fallback** fault tolerance annotation provides metrics that count the following things: the total number of annotated method invocations, the total number of failed annotated method invocations, and the total number of the fallback method calls.

The **mpMetrics** feature requires SSL and the configuration is provided for you. The **quickStartSecurity** and **keyStore** configuration elements provide basic security to secure the server. When you go to the **/metrics** endpoint, use the credentials that are defined in the server configuration to log in to view the data for the fault tolerance methods.

In your spare time you can learn more about MicroProfile Metrics in the [Providing metrics from a microservice guide](https://openliberty.io/guides/microprofile-metrics.html). You can also learn more about the MicroProfile Fault Tolerance and MicroProfile Metrics integration in the [MicroProfile Fault Tolerance specification](https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-fault-tolerance/releases).

## Building and running the application

The Open Liberty server started in **development mode** at the beginning of the guide and all the changes were automatically picked up.

Go back to the second terminal window you opened and view the the system properties of your local JVM from the **inventory** service:

`curl http://localhost:9080/inventory/systems/localhost`

Also, point your browser to the **system**  service URL to retrieve the system properties for the specific localhost. Notice that the results from the two URLs are identical because the inventory service gets its results from calling the system service:

`curl http://localhost:9080/system/properties`

To see the application metrics Log in as the **admin** user, and use **adminpwd** as the password. See the following sample outputs for the **@Fallback** annotated method and the fallback method before a fallback occurs:

`curl -k -u admin:adminpwd -D - https://localhost:9443/metrics/application`

````
# TYPE application:ft_io_openliberty_guides_inventory_inventory_manager_get_invocations_total counter
application:ft_io_openliberty_guides_inventory_inventory_manager_get_invocations_total 1
# TYPE application:ft_io_openliberty_guides_inventory_inventory_manager_get_invocations_failed_total counter
application:ft_io_openliberty_guides_inventory_inventory_manager_get_invocations_failed_total 0
# TYPE application:ft_io_openliberty_guides_inventory_inventory_manager_get_fallback_calls_total counter
application:ft_io_openliberty_guides_inventory_inventory_manager_get_fallback_calls_total 0
````

You can test the fault tolerance mechanism of your microservices by dynamically changing the **io_openliberty_guides_system_inMaintenance** property value to true in the **resources/CustomConfigSource.json** file, which turns the **system** service in maintenance.

Open the CustomConfigSource configuration file:

> [File -> Open] guide-microprofile-fallback/start/resources/CustomConfigSource.json

```json
{"config_ordinal":500,
"io_openliberty_guides_system_inMaintenance":false}
```

Change the **io_openliberty_guides_system_inMaintenance** property from **false** to **true**.

Save the file [CMD + S]

```json
{"config_ordinal":500,
"io_openliberty_guides_system_inMaintenance":true}
```

After saving re-curl to view the cached version of the properties. The **fallbackForGet()** method, which is the designated fallback method, is called when the **system** service is not available. The cached system properties contain only the OS name and user name key and value pairs.

`curl http://localhost:9080/inventory/systems/localhost`

To see that the **system** service is down, point your browser to the **system/properties** URL. You see that the service displays a 503 HTTP response code.

`curl http://localhost:9080/system/properties`

Go to **metrics/application** to see the following sample outputs for the **@Fallback** annotated method and the fallback method after a fallback occurs:

`curl -k -u admin:adminpwd -D - https://localhost:9443/metrics/application`

```
# TYPE application:ft_io_openliberty_guides_inventory_inventory_manager_get_invocations_total counter
application:ft_io_openliberty_guides_inventory_inventory_manager_get_invocations_total 2
# TYPE application:ft_io_openliberty_guides_inventory_inventory_manager_get_invocations_failed_total counter
application:ft_io_openliberty_guides_inventory_inventory_manager_get_invocations_failed_total 0
# TYPE application:ft_io_openliberty_guides_inventory_inventory_manager_get_fallback_calls_total counter
application:ft_io_openliberty_guides_inventory_inventory_manager_get_fallback_calls_total 1
```

From the output, the **ft_io_openliberty_guides_inventory_inventory_manager_get_invocations_total** data indicates that the **get()** was called twice including the previous call before turning the **system** service in maintenance. The **ft_io_openliberty_guides_inventory_inventory_manager_get_fallback_calls_total** data indicates that the **fallbackForGet()** method was called once.

Change the **io_openliberty_guides_system_inMaintenance** property value back to **false** in the **resources/CustomConfigSource.json** file.

```json
{"config_ordinal":500,
"io_openliberty_guides_system_inMaintenance":false}
```
## Testing the application 

You can test your application manually, but automated tests ensure code quality because they trigger a failure whenever a code change introduces a defect. JUnit and the JAX-RS Client API provide a simple environment for you to write tests.

On the termainl:

> Go to src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/faulttolerance/

Create the **FaultToleranceIT** class

`touch FaultToleranceIT.java`

```java
package it.io.openliberty.guides.faulttolerance;

import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals;
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertTrue;
import javax.json.JsonObject;
import javax.ws.rs.client.Client;
import javax.ws.rs.client.ClientBuilder;
import javax.ws.rs.core.Response;
import org.apache.cxf.jaxrs.provider.jsrjsonp.JsrJsonpProvider;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.AfterEach;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.BeforeEach;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;

import it.io.openliberty.guides.utils.TestUtils;

public class FaultToleranceIT {

    private Response response;
    private Client client;

    @BeforeEach
    public void setup() {
        client = ClientBuilder.newClient();
        client.register(JsrJsonpProvider.class);
    }

    @AfterEach
    public void teardown() {
        client.close();
        response.close();
    }

    @Test
    public void testFallbackForGet() throws InterruptedException {
        response = TestUtils.getResponse(client,
                                         TestUtils.INVENTORY_LOCALHOST_URL);
        assertResponse(TestUtils.baseUrl, response);
        JsonObject obj = response.readEntity(JsonObject.class);
        int propertiesSize = obj.size();
        TestUtils.changeSystemProperty(TestUtils.SYSTEM_MAINTENANCE_FALSE,
                                       TestUtils.SYSTEM_MAINTENANCE_TRUE);
        Thread.sleep(3000);
        response = TestUtils.getResponse(client,
                                         TestUtils.INVENTORY_LOCALHOST_URL);
        assertResponse(TestUtils.baseUrl, response);
        obj = response.readEntity(JsonObject.class);
        int propertiesSizeFallBack = obj.size();
        assertTrue(propertiesSize > propertiesSizeFallBack,
                   "The total number of properties from the @Fallback method "
                 + "is not smaller than the number from the system service"
                 +  "as expected.");
        TestUtils.changeSystemProperty(TestUtils.SYSTEM_MAINTENANCE_TRUE,
                                       TestUtils.SYSTEM_MAINTENANCE_FALSE);
        Thread.sleep(3000);
    }

    private void assertResponse(String url, Response response) {
        assertEquals(200, response.getStatus(), "Incorrect response code from " + url);
    }
}
```

The **@BeforeEach** and **@AfterEach** annotations indicate that this method runs either before or after the other test case. These methods are generally used to perform any setup and teardown tasks. In this case, the setup method creates a JAX-RS client, which makes HTTP requests to the **inventory** service. This client must also be registered with a JSON-P provider to process JSON resources. The teardown method simply destroys this client instance as well as the HTTP responses.

The **testFallbackForGet()** test case sends a request to the **inventory** service to get the systems properties for a hostname before and after the system service becomes unavailable. Then, it asserts outputs from the two requests to ensure that they are different from each other.

The @Test annotation indicates that the method automatically executes when your test class runs.

In addition, a few endpoint tests have been included for you to test the basic functionality of the inventory and system services. If a test failure occurs, then you might have introduced a bug into the code.

### Running the tests

Since you started Open Liberty in development mode at the start of the guide, press the **enter/return** key to run the tests. You see the following output:

```
-------------------------------------------------------
 T E S T S
-------------------------------------------------------
Running it.io.openliberty.guides.faulttolerance.FaultToleranceIT

Results :

Tests run: 5, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0
```

To see if the tests detect a failure, comment out the **changeSystemProperty()** methods in the **FaultToleranceIT.java** file. Rerun the tests to see that a test failure occurs for the **testFallbackForGet()** test case.

When you are done checking out the service, exit development mode by typing q in the shell session where you ran the server, and then press the **enter/return** key.
