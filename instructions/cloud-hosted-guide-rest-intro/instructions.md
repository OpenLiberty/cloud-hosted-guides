::page{title="Welcome to the Creating a RESTful web service guide!"}

Learn how to create a RESTful service with Jakarta Restful Web Services, JSON-B, and Open Liberty.

In this guide, you will use a pre-configured environment that runs in containers on the cloud and includes everything that you need to complete the guide.

This panel contains the step-by-step guide instructions. You can customize these instructions by using the toolbar at the top of this panel. Move between steps by using either the arrows or the buttons at the bottom of this panel.

The other panel displays the IDE that you will use to create files, edit the code, and run commands. This IDE is based on Visual Studio Code. It includes pre-installed tools and a built-in terminal.





::page{title="What you'll learn"}

You will learn how to build and test a simple RESTful service with Jakarta Restful Web Services and JSON-B, which will expose the JVM's system properties. The RESTful service responds to ***GET*** requests made to the ***http://localhost:9080/LibertyProject/system/properties*** URL.

The service responds to a ***GET*** request with a JSON representation of the system properties, where each property is a field in a JSON object, like this:

```
{
  "os.name":"Mac",
  "java.version": "1.8"
}
```

The design of an HTTP API is an essential part of creating a web application. The REST API is the go-to architectural style for building an HTTP API. The Jakarta Restful Web Services API offers functions to create, read, update, and delete exposed resources. The Jakarta Restful Web Services API supports the creation of RESTful web services that are performant, scalable, and modifiable.

::page{title="Getting started"}

To open a new command-line session,
select **Terminal** > **New Terminal** from the menu of the IDE.

Run the following command to navigate to the **/home/project** directory:

```bash
cd /home/project
```

The fastest way to work through this guide is to clone the [Git repository](https://github.com/openliberty/guide-rest-intro.git) and use the projects that are provided inside:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/openliberty/guide-rest-intro.git
cd guide-rest-intro
```


The ***start*** directory contains the starting project that you will build upon.

The ***finish*** directory contains the finished project that you will build.

### Try what you'll build

The ***finish*** directory in the root of this guide contains the finished application. Give it a try before you proceed.

To try out the application, first go to the ***finish*** directory and run the following Maven goal to build the application and deploy it to Open Liberty:

```bash
cd finish
mvn liberty:run
```

After you see the following message, your Liberty instance is ready:

```
The defaultServer server is ready to run a smarter planet.
```



Open another command-line session by selecting **Terminal** > **New Terminal** from the menu of the IDE.


Check out the service at the ***http\://localhost:9080/LibertyProject/system/properties*** URL. 


_To see the output for this URL in the IDE, run the following command at a terminal:_

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:9080/LibertyProject/system/properties | jq
```



After you are finished checking out the application, stop the Liberty instance by pressing `Ctrl+C` in the command-line session where you ran Liberty. Alternatively, you can run the ***liberty:stop*** goal from the ***finish*** directory in another shell session:

```bash
mvn liberty:stop
```


::page{title="Creating a RESTful application"}

Navigate to the ***start*** directory to begin.
```bash
cd /home/project/guide-rest-intro/start
```

When you run Open Liberty in [dev mode](https://openliberty.io/docs/latest/development-mode.html), dev mode listens for file changes and automatically recompiles and deploys your updates whenever you save a new change. Run the following goal to start Open Liberty in dev mode:

```bash
mvn liberty:dev
```

After you see the following message, your Liberty instance is ready in dev mode:

```
**************************************************************
*    Liberty is running in dev mode.
```

Dev mode holds your command-line session to listen for file changes. Open another command-line session to continue, or open the project in your editor.

Jakarta Restful Web Services defines two key concepts for creating REST APIs. The most obvious one is the resource itself, which is modelled as a class. The second is a RESTful application, which groups all exposed resources under a common path. You can think of the RESTful application as a wrapper for all of your resources.


Replace the ***SystemApplication*** class.

> To open the SystemApplication.java file in your IDE, select
> **File** > **Open** > guide-rest-intro/start/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/rest/SystemApplication.java, or click the following button

::openFile{path="/home/project/guide-rest-intro/start/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/rest/SystemApplication.java"}



```java
package io.openliberty.guides.rest;

import jakarta.ws.rs.core.Application;
import jakarta.ws.rs.ApplicationPath;

@ApplicationPath("system")
public class SystemApplication extends Application {

}
```


Click the :fa-copy: **copy** button to copy the code and press `Ctrl+V` or `Command+V` in the IDE to replace the code to the file.


The ***SystemApplication*** class extends the ***Application*** class, which associates all RESTful resource classes in the WAR file with this RESTful application. These resources become available under the common path that's specified with the ***@ApplicationPath*** annotation. The ***@ApplicationPath*** annotation has a value that indicates the path in the WAR file that the RESTful application accepts requests from.


::page{title="Creating the RESTful resource"}

In a RESTful application, a single class represents a single resource, or a group of resources of the same type. In this application, a resource might be a system property, or a set of system properties. A single class can easily handle multiple different resources, but keeping a clean separation between types of resources helps with maintainability in the long run.

Create the ***PropertiesResource*** class.

> Run the following touch command in your terminal
```bash
touch /home/project/guide-rest-intro/start/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/rest/PropertiesResource.java
```


> Then, to open the PropertiesResource.java file in your IDE, select
> **File** > **Open** > guide-rest-intro/start/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/rest/PropertiesResource.java, or click the following button

::openFile{path="/home/project/guide-rest-intro/start/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/rest/PropertiesResource.java"}



```java
package io.openliberty.guides.rest;

import java.util.Properties;

import jakarta.ws.rs.GET;
import jakarta.ws.rs.Path;
import jakarta.ws.rs.Produces;
import jakarta.ws.rs.core.MediaType;

@Path("properties")
public class PropertiesResource {

    @GET
    @Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
    public Properties getProperties() {
        return System.getProperties();
    }

}
```




The ***@Path*** annotation on the class indicates that this resource responds to the ***properties*** path in the RESTful Web Services application. The ***@ApplicationPath*** annotation in the ***SystemApplication*** class together with the ***@Path*** annotation in this class indicates that the resource is available at the ***system/properties*** path.

Jakarta Restful Web Services maps the HTTP methods on the URL to the methods of the class by using annotations. Your application uses the ***GET*** annotation to map an HTTP ***GET*** request to the ***system/properties*** path.

The ***@GET*** annotation on the method indicates that this method is called for the HTTP ***GET*** method. The ***@Produces*** annotation indicates the format of the content that is returned. The value of the ***@Produces*** annotation is specified in the HTTP ***Content-Type*** response header. This application returns a JSON structured. The desired ***Content-Type*** for a JSON response is ***application/json***, with ***MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON*** instead of the ***String*** content type. Using a constant such as ***MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON*** is better because a spelling error results in a compile failure.

Jakarta Restful Web Services supports a number of ways to marshal JSON. The Jakarta Restful Web Services specification mandates JSON-Binding (JSON-B). The method body returns the result of ***System.getProperties()***, which is of type ***java.util.Properties***. The method is annotated with ***@Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)*** so Jakarta Restful Web Services uses JSON-B to automatically convert the returned object to JSON data in the HTTP response.


::page{title="Configuring Liberty"}

To get the service running, the Liberty ***server.xml*** configuration file needs to be correctly configured.

Replace the Liberty ***server.xml*** configuration file.

> To open the server.xml file in your IDE, select
> **File** > **Open** > guide-rest-intro/start/src/main/liberty/config/server.xml, or click the following button

::openFile{path="/home/project/guide-rest-intro/start/src/main/liberty/config/server.xml"}



```xml
<server description="Intro REST Guide Liberty server">
  <featureManager>
      <feature>restfulWS-3.1</feature>
      <feature>jsonb-3.0</feature>
  </featureManager>

  <httpEndpoint httpPort="${http.port}" httpsPort="${https.port}"
                id="defaultHttpEndpoint" host="*" />

  <webApplication location="guide-rest-intro.war" contextRoot="${app.context.root}"/>
</server>
```



The configuration does the following actions:

* Configures Liberty to enable Jakarta Restful Web Services. This is specified in the ***featureManager*** element.
* Configures Liberty to resolve the HTTP port numbers from variables, which are then specified in the Maven ***pom.xml*** file. This is specified in the ***httpEndpoint*** element. Variables use the ***${variableName}*** syntax.
* Configures Liberty to run the produced web application on a context root specified in the ***pom.xml*** file. This is specified in the ***webApplication*** element.


The variables that are being used in the ***server.xml*** file are provided by the properties set in the Maven ***pom.xml*** file. The properties must be formatted as ***liberty.var.variableName***.


::page{title="Running the application"}

You started the Open Liberty in dev mode at the beginning of the guide, so all the changes were automatically picked up.


Check out the service that you created at the ***http\://localhost:9080/LibertyProject/system/properties*** URL. 


_To see the output for this URL in the IDE, run the following command at a terminal:_

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:9080/LibertyProject/system/properties | jq
```




::page{title="Testing the service"}


You can test this service manually by starting Liberty and visiting the http://localhost:9080/LibertyProject/system/properties URL. However, automated tests are a much better approach because they trigger a failure if a change introduces a bug. JUnit and the Jakarta Restful Web Services Client API provide a simple environment to test the application.

You can write tests for the individual units of code outside of a running Liberty instance, or they can be written to call the Liberty instance directly. In this example, you will create a test that does the latter.

Create the ***EndpointIT*** class.

> Run the following touch command in your terminal
```bash
touch /home/project/guide-rest-intro/start/src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/rest/EndpointIT.java
```


> Then, to open the EndpointIT.java file in your IDE, select
> **File** > **Open** > guide-rest-intro/start/src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/rest/EndpointIT.java, or click the following button

::openFile{path="/home/project/guide-rest-intro/start/src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/rest/EndpointIT.java"}



```java
package it.io.openliberty.guides.rest;

import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals;

import java.util.Properties;

import jakarta.json.bind.Jsonb;
import jakarta.json.bind.JsonbBuilder;
import jakarta.ws.rs.client.Client;
import jakarta.ws.rs.client.ClientBuilder;
import jakarta.ws.rs.client.WebTarget;
import jakarta.ws.rs.core.Response;

import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;

public class EndpointIT {
    private static final Jsonb JSONB = JsonbBuilder.create();
    @Test
    public void testGetProperties() {
        String port = System.getProperty("http.port");
        String context = System.getProperty("context.root");
        String url = "http://localhost:" + port + "/" + context + "/";

        Client client = ClientBuilder.newClient();

        WebTarget target = client.target(url + "system/properties");
        Response response = target.request().get();

        assertEquals(Response.Status.OK.getStatusCode(), response.getStatus(),
                     "Incorrect response code from " + url);

        String json = response.readEntity(String.class);
        Properties sysProps = JSONB.fromJson(json, Properties.class);

        assertEquals(System.getProperty("os.name"), sysProps.getProperty("os.name"),
                     "The system property for the local and remote JVM should match");
        response.close();
        client.close();
    }
}
```



This test class has more lines of code than the resource implementation. This situation is common. The test method is indicated with the ***@Test*** annotation.


The test code needs to know some information about the application to make requests. The server port and the application context root are key, and are dictated by the Liberty's configuration. While this information can be hardcoded, it is better to specify it in a single place like the Maven ***pom.xml*** file. Refer to the ***pom.xml*** file to see how the application information such as the ***http.port***, ***https.port*** and ***app.context.root*** elements are provided in the file.


These Maven properties are then passed to the Java test program as the ***systemPropertyVariables*** element in the ***pom.xml*** file.

Getting the values to create a representation of the URL is simple. The test class uses the ***getProperty*** method to get the application details.

To call the RESTful service using the Jakarta Restful Web Services client, first create a ***WebTarget*** object by calling the ***target*** method that provides the URL. To cause the HTTP request to occur, the ***request().get()*** method is called on the ***WebTarget*** object. The ***get*** method call is a synchronous call that blocks until a response is received. This call returns a ***Response*** object, which can be inspected to determine whether the request was successful.

The first thing to check is that a ***200*** response was received. The JUnit ***assertEquals*** method can be used for this check.

Check the response body to ensure it returned the right information. The client and the server are running on the same machine so it is reasonable to expect that the system properties for the local and remote JVM would be the same. In this case, an ***assertEquals*** assertion is made so that the ***os.name*** system property for both JVMs is the same. You can write additional assertions to check for more values.

### Running the tests

Because you started Open Liberty in dev mode, you can run the tests by pressing the ***enter/return*** key from the command-line session where you started dev mode.

You will see the following output:

```
-------------------------------------------------------
 T E S T S
-------------------------------------------------------
Running it.io.openliberty.guides.rest.EndpointIT
Tests run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 2.884 sec - in it.io.openliberty.guides.rest.EndpointIT

Results :

Tests run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0
```

To see whether the tests detect a failure, add an assertion that you know fails, or change the existing assertion to a constant value that doesn't match the ***os.name*** system property.

When you are done checking out the service, exit dev mode by pressing `Ctrl+C` in the command-line session where you ran Liberty.
