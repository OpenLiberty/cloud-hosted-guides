# Creating a RESTful web service


Learn how to create a REST service with JAX-RS, JSON-B, and Open Liberty.



## What you'll learn

You will learn how to build and test a simple REST service with JAX-RS and JSON-B, which will expose
the JVM's system properties. The REST service will respond to **GET** requests made to the **\http://localhost:9080/LibertyProject/System/properties** URL.

The service responds to a **GET** request with a JSON representation of the system properties, where
each property is a field in a JSON object like this:

```
{
  "os.name":"Mac",
  "java.version": "1.8"
}
```

The design of an HTTP API is essential when creating a web application. The REST API has 
become the go-to architectural style for building an HTTP API. The JAX-RS API offers 
functionality for creating, reading, updating, and deleting exposed resources. The JAX-RS API 
supports the creation of RESTful web services that come with desirable properties, 
such as performance, scalability, and modifiability.

# Getting started

Open a terminal window:

> [Terminal -> New Terminal]

Navigate to the **/home/project** directory:

```
cd /home/project
```
{: codeblock}

The fastest way to work through this guide is to clone the [Git repository](https://github.com/openliberty/guide-rest-intro.git) and use the projects that are provided inside:

```
git clone https://github.com/openliberty/guide-rest-intro.git
cd guide-rest-intro
```
{: codeblock}


The **start** directory contains the starting project that you will build upon.

The **finish** directory contains the finished project that you will build.

### Try what you'll build

The **finish** directory in the root of this guide contains the finished application. Give it a try before you proceed.

To try out the application, first go to the **finish** directory and run the following
Maven goal to build the application and deploy it to Open Liberty:

```
cd finish
mvn liberty:run
```
{: codeblock}


After you see the following message, your application server is ready:

```
The defaultServer server is ready to run a smarter planet.
```

Check out the service at the
[http://localhost:9080/LibertyProject/System/properties](http://localhost:9080/LibertyProject/System/properties) URL 

```
curl http://localhost:9080/LibertyProject/System/properties
```
{: codeblock}



After you are finished checking out the application, stop the Open Liberty server by pressing **CTRL+C**
in the command-line session where you ran the server. Alternatively, you can run the **liberty:stop** goal
from the **finish** directory in another shell session:

```
mvn liberty:stop
```
{: codeblock}



# Creating a JAX-RS application

Navigate to the **start** directory to begin.

When you run Open Liberty in development mode, known as dev mode, the server listens for file changes and automatically recompiles and 
deploys your updates whenever you save a new change. Run the following goal to start Open Liberty in dev mode:

```
mvn liberty:dev
```
{: codeblock}


After you see the following message, your application server in dev mode is ready:

```
Press the Enter key to run tests on demand.
```

Dev mode holds your command-line session to listen for file changes. Open another command-line session to continue, 
or open the project in your editor.

JAX-RS has two key concepts for creating REST APIs. The most obvious one is the resource itself, which is
modelled as a class. The second is a JAX-RS application, which groups all exposed resources under a
common path. You can think of the JAX-RS application as a wrapper for all of your resources.


Replace the **SystemApplication** class.


> [File -> Open...]  
> guide-rest-intro/start/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/rest/SystemApplication.java



```
package io.openliberty.guides.rest;

import javax.ws.rs.core.Application;
import javax.ws.rs.ApplicationPath;

@ApplicationPath("System")
public class SystemApplication extends Application {

}
```
{: codeblock}


The **SystemApplication** class extends the **Application** class, which associates all JAX-RS resource classes in the WAR file with this JAX-RS application. These resources become available under the common path that's specified with the **@ApplicationPath** 
annotation. The **@ApplicationPath** annotation has a value that indicates the path in the WAR file that 
the JAX-RS application accepts requests from.




# Creating the JAX-RS resource

In JAX-RS, a single class should represent a single resource, or a group of resources of the same type.
In this application, a resource might be a system property, or a set of system properties. It is easy
to have a single class handle multiple different resources, but keeping a clean separation between types
of resources helps with maintainability in the long run.

Create the **PropertiesResource** class.


> [File -> New File]  
> guide-rest-intro/start/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/rest/PropertiesResource.java



```
package io.openliberty.guides.rest;

import java.util.Properties;

import javax.ws.rs.GET;
import javax.ws.rs.Path;
import javax.ws.rs.Produces;
import javax.ws.rs.core.MediaType;

@Path("properties")
public class PropertiesResource {

    @GET
    @Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
    public Properties getProperties() {
        return System.getProperties();
    }

}
```
{: codeblock}


This resource class has quite a bit of code in it, so let's break it down into manageable chunks.

The **@Path** annotation on the class indicates that this resource responds to the **properties** path
in the JAX-RS application. The **@ApplicationPath** annotation in the **SystemApplication** class together with
the **@Path** annotation in this class indicates that the resource is available at the **System/properties**
path.

JAX-RS maps the HTTP methods on the URL to the methods of the class by using annotations. 
Your application uses the **GET** annotation to map an HTTP **GET** request
to the **System/properties** path.

The **@GET** annotation on the method indicates that this method is to be called for the HTTP **GET**
method. The **@Produces** annotation indicates the format of the content that will be returned. The
value of the **@Produces** annotation will be specified in the HTTP **Content-Type** response header.
For this application, a JSON structure is to be returned. The desired **Content-Type** for a JSON
response is **application/json** with **MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON** instead of the **String** content type. Using a constant such as **MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON** is better because if there's a spelling error, a compile failure occurs.

JAX-RS supports a number of ways to marshal JSON. The JAX-RS 2.1 specification mandates JSON-Binding
(JSON-B). The method body returns the result of **System.getProperties()**, which is of type **java.util.Properties**. Since the method 
is annotated with **@Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)**, JAX-RS uses JSON-B to automatically convert the returned object
to JSON data in the HTTP response.





# Configuring the server

To get the service running, the Liberty server needs to be correctly configured.

Replace the server configuration file.


> [File -> Open...]  
> guide-rest-intro/start/src/main/liberty/config/server.xml



```
<server description="Intro REST Guide Liberty server">
  <!-- tag::featureManager[] -->
  <featureManager>
      <feature>jaxrs-2.1</feature>
  </featureManager>
  <!-- end::featureManager[] -->

  <!-- tag::httpEndpoint[] -->
  <httpEndpoint httpPort="${default.http.port}" httpsPort="${default.https.port}"
                id="defaultHttpEndpoint" host="*" />
  <!-- end::httpEndpoint[] -->
  
  <!-- tag::webApplication[] -->
  <webApplication location="guide-rest-intro.war" contextRoot="${app.context.root}"/>
  <!-- end::webApplication[] -->
</server>
```
{: codeblock}



The configuration does the following actions:

. Configures the server to enable JAX-RS. This is specified in the **featureManager** element.
. Configures the server to resolve the HTTP port numbers from variables, which are then specified in
the Maven **pom.xml** file. This is specified in the **<httpEndpoint/>** element. Variables use the **${variableName}** syntax.
. Configures the server to run the produced web application on a context root specified in the 
**pom.xml** file. This is specified in the **<webApplication/>** element.


The variables that are being used in the **server.xml** file are provided by the properties set in the Maven **pom.xml** file. The properties must be formatted as **liberty.var.variableName**.


# Running the application

You started the Open Liberty server in dev mode at the beginning of the guide, so all the changes were automatically picked up.

Check out the service that you created at the
[http://localhost:9080/LibertyProject/System/properties](http://localhost:9080/LibertyProject/System/properties) URL 

```
curl http://localhost:9080/LibertyProject/System/properties
```
{: codeblock}




# Testing the service

You can test this service manually by starting a server and pointing a web browser at the
[http://localhost:9080/LibertyProject/System/properties](http://localhost:9080/LibertyProject/System/properties) URL However, automated tests are a 

```
curl http://localhost:9080/LibertyProject/System/properties
```
{: codeblock}


much better approach because they trigger a failure if a change introduces a bug. JUnit and the JAX-RS 
Client API provide a simple environment to test the application.

You can write tests for the individual units of code outside of a running application server, or they
can be written to call the application server directly. In this example, you will create a test that
does the latter.

Create the **EndpointIT** class.


> [File -> New File]  
> guide-rest-intro/start/src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/rest/EndpointIT.java



```
package it.io.openliberty.guides.rest;

import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals;

import java.util.Properties;

import javax.json.bind.Jsonb;
import javax.json.bind.JsonbBuilder;
import javax.ws.rs.client.Client;
import javax.ws.rs.client.ClientBuilder;
import javax.ws.rs.client.WebTarget;
import javax.ws.rs.core.Response;

import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;

public class EndpointIT {
    
    private static final Jsonb jsonb = JsonbBuilder.create();

    @Test
    public void testGetProperties() {
        String port = System.getProperty("http.port");
        String context = System.getProperty("context.root");
        String url = "http://localhost:" + port + "/" + context + "/";

        Client client = ClientBuilder.newClient();

        WebTarget target = client.target(url + "System/properties");
        Response response = target.request().get();

        assertEquals(Response.Status.OK.getStatusCode(), response.getStatus(),
                     "Incorrect response code from " + url);

        String json = response.readEntity(String.class);
        Properties sysProps = jsonb.fromJson(json, Properties.class);

        assertEquals(System.getProperty("os.name"), sysProps.getProperty("os.name"),
                     "The system property for the local and remote JVM should match");
        response.close();
    }
}
```
{: codeblock}



This test class has more lines of code than the resource implementation. This situation is common.
The test method is indicated with the **@Test** annotation.


The test code needs to know some information about the application to make requests. The server port and the application context root are key, and are dictated by the server configuration. While this information can be hardcoded, it is better to specify it in a single place like the Maven **pom.xml** file. Refer to the **pom.xml** file to see how the application information such as the **default.http.port**, **default.https.port** and **app.context.root** elements are provided in the file.


These Maven properties are then passed to the Java test program as the **<systemPropertyVariables/>** element in the **pom.xml** file.

Getting the values to create a representation of the URL is simple. The test class uses the **getProperty** method
to get the application details.

To call the JAX-RS service using the JAX-RS client, first create a **WebTarget** object by calling
the **target** method that provides the URL. To cause the HTTP request to occur, the **request().get()** method
is called on the **WebTarget** object. The **get** method
call is a synchronous call that blocks until a response is received. This call returns a **Response**
object, which can be inspected to determine whether the request was successful.

The first thing to check is that a **200** response was received. The JUnit **assertEquals** method can be used for this check.

Check the response body to ensure it returned the right information. Since the client and the server
are running on the same machine, it is reasonable to expect that the system properties for the local
and remote JVM would be the same. In this case, an **assertEquals** assertion is made so that the **os.name** system property
for both JVMs is the same. You can write additional assertions to check for more values.

### Running the tests

Because you started Open Liberty in dev mode, press the **enter/return** key to run the tests.

You will see the following output:

```
-------------------------------------------------------
 T E S T S
-------------------------------------------------------
Running it.io.openliberty.guides.rest.EndpointIT
Tests run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 2.884 sec - in it.io.openliberty.guides.rest.EndpointIT

Results :

Tests run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0
```

To see whether the tests detect a failure, add an assertion that you know fails, or change the existing
assertion to a constant value that doesn't match the **os.name** system property.

When you are done checking out the service, exit dev mode by pressing **CTRL+C** in the command-line session
where you ran the server, or by typing **q** and then pressing the **enter/return** key.
