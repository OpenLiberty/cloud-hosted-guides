# Learn how to use MicroShed Testing to test a MicroProfile or Jakarta EE application

### What you will learn

You'll start with an existing REST application that runs on Open Liberty and use [MicroShed Testing](https://microshed.org/microshed-testing/) to write tests for the application that exercise the application inside of a Docker container.

Sometimes tests might pass in development and testing (dev/test) environments, but fail in production because the application is running differently in production than it is in dev/test. Fortunately, you can minimize these parity issues between development and production by testing your application in the same Docker container that you'll use in production.

### Introduction

Docker is a tool that you can use to deploy and run applications with containers. You
can think of Docker as a virtual machine that runs various applications. However, unlike with a typical virtual
machine, you can run these applications simultaneously on a single system and independent of
one another.

Learn more about Docker on the [official Docker website](https://www.docker.com/what-docker).

## Getting Started

If a terminal window does not open navigate:

> Terminal -> New Terminal

Check you are in the **home/project** folder:

```
pwd
```
{: codeblock}

The fastest way to work through this guide is to clone the Git repository and use the projects that are provided inside:

```
git clone https://github.com/openliberty/guide-microshed-testing.git
cd guide-microshed-testing
```
{: codeblock}

# Try what you'll build

The **finish** directory in the root of this guide contains the finished application. Give it a try before you proceed.

First, review the **PersonServiceIT** class to see what the tests look like:

> [File -> Open] finish/src/test/java/io/openliberty/guides/testing/PersonServiceIT.java

To try out the application, go to the **finish** directory and run the following Maven 
goal to build the application and run the integration tests on an Open Liberty server in a container:

```
cd finish
mvn verify
```
{: codeblock}

This command might take some time to run the first time because the dependencies and the Docker image for Open Liberty must download. If you run the same command again, it will be faster.

The previous example shows how you can run integration tests from a cold start. With Open Liberty development mode, you can use MicroShed Testing to run tests on an already running Open Liberty server. Run the following Maven goal to start Open Liberty in development mode:


```
mvn liberty:dev
```
{: codeblock}

After the Open Liberty server starts and you see the **Press the Enter key** to run tests on demand. message, you can press the **enter/return** key to run the integration tests. After the tests finish, you can press the **enter/return** key to run the tests again, or you can make code changes to the application or tests. Development mode automatically recompiles and updates any application or test code changes that you make.

Exit development mode:

```
Type **q** in the shell session where you ran the server.
Press the **enter/return** key to stop the server.
```

# Bootstrapping your application for testing

Navigate to the **start** directory to begin.

```
cd ../start
```
{: codeblock}

Start Open Liberty in development mode, which starts the Open Liberty server and listens for file changes:

```
mvn liberty:dev
```
{: codeblock}

Wait for the **Press the Enter key to run tests on demand.** message, and then press the **enter/return** key to run the tests. You see that one test runs:

```
 Running integration tests...

 -------------------------------------------------------
  T E S T S
 -------------------------------------------------------
 Running io.openliberty.guides.testing.PersonServiceIT
 Tests run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 0.024 s - in io.openliberty.guides.testing.PersonServiceIT

 Results:

 Tests run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0

 Integration tests finished.
```

To begin bootstrapping, annotate the **PersonServiceIT.java** class with the **@MicroShedTest** annotation. This annotation indicates that the test class uses MicroShed Testing.

> [File->Open] guide-start/src/test/java/io/openliberty/guides/testing/PersonServiceIT.java

Import the MicroShedTest annotation by inserting the following line in to the **PersonServiceIT.java** file below the existing **import** statement: 

```
import org.microshed.testing.jupiter.MicroShedTest;
```
{: codeblock}

Add the **MicroShedTest** annotation above **PersonServiceIT** declaration:

```
@MicroShedTest
```
{: codeblock}

Next, the **PersonServiceIT** class outlines some basic information that informs how MicroShed Testing starts the application runtime and at which URL path the application will be available. Import the **ApplicationContainer** class and the **Container** annotation, create the **ApplicationContainer** application, and annotate the application with **@Container**. 

To do this, add the following after the existing **import** statements in the **PersonServiceIT.java** file:

```
import org.microshed.testing.testcontainers.ApplicationContainer;
import org.testcontainers.junit.jupiter.Container;
```
{: codeblock}

Add the following to the **PersonServiceIT** class:

```
 @Container
    public static ApplicationContainer app = new ApplicationContainer()
                    .withAppContextRoot("/guide-microshed-testing")
                    .withReadinessPath("/health/ready");
```
{: codeblock}

Save your changes to the **PersonServiceIT.java** file. 

The **withAppContextRoot(String)** method indicates the base path of the application. The app context root is the portion of the URL after the hostname and port. In this case, the application is deployed at the **http://localhost:9080/guide-microshed-testing** URL, so the app context root is /guide-microshed-testing.

The **withReadinessPath(String)** method indicates what path is polled by HTTP to determine application readiness. MicroShed Testing automatically starts the ApplicationContainer application and waits for it to be ready before the tests start running. In this case, you are using the default application readiness check at the **http://localhost:9080/health/ready** URL, which is enabled by the MicroProfile Health feature in our **server.xml** configuration file. When the readiness URL returns **HTTP 200**, the application is considered ready and the tests begin running.

Open a new Terminal by pressing the window button the top right hand corner of the terminal pane.

Run the following command to call the microservice URL:

```
curl http://localhost:9080/health/ready
```
{: codeblock}

The response output should return back with:

```
{"checks":[],"status":"UP"}
```
Navigate back to the Open Liberty terminal window to rerun the tests.

```
Press **enter/return key** in your console window
```

 You still see only one test running, but the output is different. Notice that MicroShed Testing is using a **hollow** configuration mode. This configuration mode means that MicroShed Testing is reusing an existing application runtime for the test, not starting up a new application instance each time you initiate a test run.

# Talking to your application with a REST client

With MicroShed Testing, applications are exercised in a black-box fashion. Black-box means the tests cannot access the application internals. Instead, the application is exercised from the outside, usually with HTTP requests. To simplify the HTTP interactions, inject a REST client into the tests.

Import the **RESTClient** annotation after the existing imports in the **PersonServiceIT.java** file:

```
import org.microshed.testing.jaxrs.RESTClient;
```
{: codeblock}

Add the following to the **PersonServiceIT** class:

```
@RESTClient
    public static PersonService personSvc;
```
{: codeblock}

In this example, the **PersonService** injected type is the same **io.openliberty.guides.testing.PersonService** class that is used in your application. However, the instance that gets injected is a REST client proxy. So, if you call **personSvc.createPerson("Bob", 42)**, the REST client makes an HTTP POST request to the application that is running at **http://localhost:9080/guide-microshed-testing/people**, which triggers the corresponding Java method in the application. 

In the other terminal, run the following command to access this endpoint: 

```
curl http://localhost:9080/guide-microshed-testing/people
```
{: codeblock}

# Writing your first test

Now that the setup is complete, you can write your first test case. Start by testing the basic "create person" use case for your REST-based application. To test this use case, use the REST client thatâ€™s injected by MicroShed Testing to make the HTTP POST request to the application and read the response.

If you closed the **PersonServiceIT.java** re-open it:

> [File -> Open] start/src/test/java/io/openliberty/guides/testing/PersonServiceIT.java

Import the **assertNotNull** static method and write the test logic in the **testCreatePerson()** method. To do this, add the following 

To do this, add the following line after the existing imports in the **PersonServiceIT.java** file:

```
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertNotNull;
```
{: codeblock}

Add the test logic in the **PersonServiceIT.java** file in the **testCreatePerson** method:

```
    Long createId = personSvc.createPerson("Hank", 42);
    assertNotNull(createId);

```
{: codeblock}

Your first test case should look like:

```java
 @Test
    public void testCreatePerson() {
        Long createId = personSvc.createPerson("Hank", 42);
        assertNotNull(createId);
    }
```
Save the changes. 

Run the tests in the Open Liberty terminal window:

```
Press the **enter/return** key in your console window to 
```

You see that the test ran again and exercised the REST endpoint of your application,including the response of your applicationâ€™s endpoint:

```
INFO org.microshed.testing.jaxrs.RestClientBuilder  - Building rest client for class io.openliberty.guides.testing.PersonService with base path: http://localhost:9080/guide-microshed-testing/ and providers: [class org.microshed.testing.jaxrs.JsonBProvider]
INFO org.microshed.testing.jaxrs.JsonBProvider  - Response from server: 1809686877352335426
```
Next, add more tests to the **PersonServiceIT** class. The following tests are added: **testMinSizeName()**, **testMinAge()**, **testGetPerson()**, **testGetAllPeople()**, and **testUpdateAge()**.

Replace the PersonServiceIT class with:

```java
package io.openliberty.guides.testing;

import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals;
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertNotNull;
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertTrue;

import java.util.Collection;

import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import org.microshed.testing.jaxrs.RESTClient;
import org.microshed.testing.jupiter.MicroShedTest;
import org.microshed.testing.testcontainers.ApplicationContainer;
import org.testcontainers.junit.jupiter.Container;

@MicroShedTest
public class PersonServiceIT {

    @RESTClient
    public static PersonService personSvc;

    @Container
    public static ApplicationContainer app = new ApplicationContainer()
                    .withAppContextRoot("/guide-microshed-testing")
                    .withReadinessPath("/health/ready");

    @Test
    public void testCreatePerson() {
        Long createId = personSvc.createPerson("Hank", 42);
        assertNotNull(createId);
    }

    @Test
    public void testMinSizeName() {
        Long minSizeNameId = personSvc.createPerson("Ha", 42);
        assertEquals(new Person("Ha", 42, minSizeNameId),
                     personSvc.getPerson(minSizeNameId));
    }

    @Test
    public void testMinAge() {
        Long minAgeId = personSvc.createPerson("Newborn", 0);
        assertEquals(new Person("Newborn", 0, minAgeId),
                     personSvc.getPerson(minAgeId));
    }

    @Test
    public void testGetPerson() {
        Long bobId = personSvc.createPerson("Bob", 24);
        Person bob = personSvc.getPerson(bobId);
        assertEquals("Bob", bob.name);
        assertEquals(24, bob.age);
        assertNotNull(bob.id);
    }

    @Test
    public void testGetAllPeople() {
        Long person1Id = personSvc.createPerson("Person1", 1);
        Long person2Id = personSvc.createPerson("Person2", 2);

        Person expected1 = new Person("Person1", 1, person1Id);
        Person expected2 = new Person("Person2", 2, person2Id);

        Collection<Person> allPeople = personSvc.getAllPeople();
        assertTrue(allPeople.size() >= 2,
            "Expected at least 2 people to be registered, but there were only: " +
            allPeople);
        assertTrue(allPeople.contains(expected1),
            "Did not find person " + expected1 + " in all people: " + allPeople);
        assertTrue(allPeople.contains(expected2),
            "Did not find person " + expected2 + " in all people: " + allPeople);
    }

    @Test
    public void testUpdateAge() {
        Long personId = personSvc.createPerson("newAgePerson", 1);

        Person originalPerson = personSvc.getPerson(personId);
        assertEquals("newAgePerson", originalPerson.name);
        assertEquals(1, originalPerson.age);
        assertEquals(personId, Long.valueOf(originalPerson.id));

        personSvc.updatePerson(personId,
            new Person(originalPerson.name, 2, originalPerson.id));
        Person updatedPerson = personSvc.getPerson(personId);
        assertEquals("newAgePerson", updatedPerson.name);
        assertEquals(2, updatedPerson.age);
        assertEquals(personId, Long.valueOf(updatedPerson.id));
    }
}
```
{: codeblock}

Save the changes, and press the **enter/return** key in your console window to run the tests.

# Testing outside of development mode

Running tests in development mode is convenient for local development, but it can be tedious to test against a running Open Liberty server in non-development scenarios such as CI/CD pipelines. For this reason, MicroShed Testing can start and stop the application runtime before and after the tests are run. This process is primarily accomplished by using Docker and Testcontainers.

To test outside of development mode, exit development mode:

```
Type **q** in the shell session where you ran the server.
Press the **enter/return** key to stop the server.
```

Next, use the following Maven goal to run the tests from a cold start:

```
mvn verify
```
{: codeblock}

Running tests from a cold start takes a little longer than running tests from development mode because the application runtime needs to start each time. However, tests that are run from a cold start use a clean instance on each run to ensure consistent results. These tests also automatically hook into existing build pipelines that are set up to run the **integration-test** phase.

Once the tests have completed successfully you should see:

```
[INFO] Results:
[INFO] 
[INFO] Tests run: 6, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0
```

# Sharing configuration across multiple classes

Typically, projects have multiple test classes that all use the same type of application deployment. For these cases, it is useful to reuse an existing configuration and application lifecycle across multiple test classes.

First, create another test class.

Create the **ErrorPathIT** class:

```
touch src/test/java/io/openliberty/guides/testing/ErrorPathIT.java
```
{: codeblock}

The **ErrorPathIT** test class has the same **@Container** configuration and **PersonService** REST client as the **PersonServiceIT** class.

Add the additional tests:

```java
package io.openliberty.guides.testing;

import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertThrows;

import javax.ws.rs.BadRequestException;
import javax.ws.rs.NotFoundException;

import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import org.microshed.testing.jupiter.MicroShedTest;
import org.microshed.testing.testcontainers.ApplicationContainer;
import org.testcontainers.junit.jupiter.Container;
import org.microshed.testing.jaxrs.RESTClient;

@MicroShedTest
public class ErrorPathIT {

    @Container
    public static ApplicationContainer app = new ApplicationContainer()
                    .withAppContextRoot("/guide-microshed-testing")
                    .withReadinessPath("/health/ready");

    @RESTClient
    public static PersonService personSvc;

    @Test
    public void testGetUnknownPerson() {
        assertThrows(NotFoundException.class, () -> personSvc.getPerson(-1L));
    }

    @Test
    public void testCreateBadPersonNullName() {
        assertThrows(BadRequestException.class, () -> personSvc.createPerson(null, 5));
    }

    @Test
    public void testCreateBadPersonNegativeAge() {
        assertThrows(BadRequestException.class, () ->
          personSvc.createPerson("NegativeAgePersoN", -1));
    }

    @Test
    public void testCreateBadPersonNameTooLong() {
        assertThrows(BadRequestException.class, () ->
          personSvc.createPerson("NameTooLongPersonNameTooLongPersonNameTooLongPerson",
          5));
    }
}
```
{: codeblock}

The **ErrorPathIT** test class has the same **@Container** configuration and **PersonService** REST client as the **PersonServiceIT** class.

Now, run the tests again outside of development mode:

```
mvn verify
```
{: codeblock}

Notice that tests for both the **PersonServiceIT** and **ErrorPathIT** classes run, but a new server starts for each test class, resulting in a longer test runtime.

To solve this issue, common configuration can be placed in a class that implements **SharedContainerConfiguration**. 

Create the **AppDeploymentConfig** class:

```
touch src/test/java/io/openliberty/guides/testing/AppDeploymentConfig.java
```

Add the **AppDeplyomentConfig** logic which implements the **SharedContainerConfiguration** interface:

```
package io.openliberty.guides.testing;

import org.microshed.testing.SharedContainerConfiguration;
import org.microshed.testing.testcontainers.ApplicationContainer;
import org.testcontainers.junit.jupiter.Container;

public class AppDeploymentConfig implements SharedContainerConfiguration {

    @Container
    public static ApplicationContainer app = new ApplicationContainer()
                    .withAppContextRoot("/guide-microshed-testing")
                    .withReadinessPath("/health/ready");

}
```
{: codeblock}

After the common configuration is created, the test classes can be updated to reference this shared configuration.

Remove the container code from the **PersonServiceIT** class. 

> [File->Open] src/test/java/io/openliberty/guides/testing/PersonServiceIT.java

Remove the following parts of code:

```
import org.microshed.testing.testcontainers.ApplicationContainer;
import org.testcontainers.junit.jupiter.Container;
```

```
@Container
    public static ApplicationContainer app = new ApplicationContainer()
                    .withAppContextRoot("/guide-microshed-testing")
                    .withReadinessPath("/health/ready");
```

Annotate the **PersonServiceIT** class with the **@SharedContainerConfig** annotation that references the **AppDeploymentConfig** shared configuration class.

To do this, add the following line below the existing **import** statements in the **PersonServiceIT.java** file:

```
import org.microshed.testing.SharedContainerConfig;
```
{: codeblock}

Add the following to the **PersonServiceIT.java** file above the **PersonServiceIT** declaration:

```
@SharedContainerConfig(AppDeploymentConfig.class)
```
{: codeblock}

Your declaration should look like:

```java
@MicroShedTest
@SharedContainerConfig(AppDeploymentConfig.class)
public class PersonServiceIT {
```


Similarly, update the **ErrorPathIT** class to remove the container code.

> [File->Open] src/test/java/io/openliberty/guides/testing/ErrorPathIT.java

Remove the **import** statements and **@Container** annotation code: 

```
import org.microshed.testing.testcontainers.ApplicationContainer;
import org.testcontainers.junit.jupiter.Container;
``` 

```
@Container
    public static ApplicationContainer app = new ApplicationContainer()
                    .withAppContextRoot("/guide-microshed-testing")
                    .withReadinessPath("/health/ready");
```
Annotate the **ErrorPathIT** class with the **@SharedContainerConfig** annotation.

To do this, start by adding the following line after the existing import statements in the **ErrorPathIT.java** file: 

```
import org.microshed.testing.SharedContainerConfig;
```
{: codeblock}

Add the following to the **ErrorPathIT.java** file before the **ErrorPathIT** declaration: 

```
@SharedContainerConfig(AppDeploymentConfig.class)
```
{: codeblock}

Your declaration should look like:

```java
@MicroShedTest
@SharedContainerConfig(AppDeploymentConfig.class)
public class ErrorPathIT {
```

If you rerun the tests now, they run in about half the time because the same server instance is being used for both test classes:

```
mvn verify
```
{: codeblock}

# Summary

### Clean up your environment

Delete the **guide-microshed-testing** project by navigating to the **/home/project/** directory

```
rm -r -f guide-microshed-testing
```
{: codeblock}

### Well Done

Nice work! You developed automated tests for a REST service in Open Liberty by using MicroShed Testing and Open Liberty development mode.
