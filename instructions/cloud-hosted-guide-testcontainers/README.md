# Welcome to your Guided Project

The information in this README.md is crucial for your success. Please, **do not skip or ignore the instructions** provided here. We are constantly enhancing our process so please check it out even even if you have done a few Guided Projects before. 

## Exploring your GitLab project

Please take a minute to explore the files in your GitLab project. The GitLab project for your lab will have:
- *READ.me*: this file. It contains simple instructions for you to follow.
- *instructions.md*: write instructions for your learners to follow in this file. Your instructions should be written in <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/" target="_blank" title="Link: https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/">markdown</a>
- *images* folder: place any images you will be using in your instructions in this folder. <!-- Also, please create a poster (a 100px * 100px jpeg or png) for your Guided Project and place it in this folder. We will use this poster when publishing your Guided Project in the Skills Network learning portals. -->
- *.gitlab-ci.yml*: don't touch this file as it contains data for driving the CI/CD processs

## Authoring Guided Project content

Skills Network Guided Projects are composed of two parts:
1. Instructions for larners to follow, and
2. tools to run the Guided Project

You create write lab instructions in the *instructions.md* file. 

1. Find instructions.md file in your project and click on it
2. Click on the `Edit` button to bring it up in the GitLab editor. If you want to use your own editor, we will leave the process as an excercise for you to figure out on your own.
3. You may want to turn *Soft wrap* on to prevent excessive horizontal scrolling.
4. Please read the contents of instructions.md as these are provided as guidance for you to follow.
5. Write instructions for your Guided Project users following the suggestions and best practices.
6. Click on `Commit changes` button when done. Make sure you are committing to master branch if you want your lab to be published. Please provide a meaningfull information describing the changes you have made in the *Commit message* field.

Hint: you may find it usefull to have the work-in-progress version of your Guided Project open in a separate browser window. To do so, you will want to make a minor change to the instructions.md and commit it to master. Look for instructions in the Publishing your Guided Project section for how to experience your Guided Project as a user would.   

## Making your Guided Project available for publication

Your Guided Project is available for publication when its assets (instructions.md file and associated images) are uploaded to the Skills Network Asset Library (SN Asset Library). SN Asset Library is powered by the IBM Cloud Object Storage (COS) and provides fast highly available file store. 

Your contents are published to the SN Asset Library by the CI/CD process every time you commit changes to master branch. No action is required on your part. The process can take 5-10 minutes so you will need to be patient. You can monitor completion of the CI/CD process by clicking on CI/CD in the left navigation bar of GitLab.

## Publishing your Guided Project

Please visit your project on [Author Workbench](https://author.skills.network) for publishing instruction.
